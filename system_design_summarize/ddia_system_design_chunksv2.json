Much has been said on this topic already [ 31, 32, 33].\nWhen complexity makes maintenance hard, budgets and schedules are often over\u2010\nrun. In complex software, there is also a greater risk of introducing bugs when mak\u2010\ning a change: when the system is harder for developers to understand and reason\nabout, hidden assumptions, unintended consequences, and unexpected interactions\nare more easily overlooked. Conversely, reducing complexity greatly improves the\nmaintainability of software, and thus simplicity should be a key goal for the systems\nwe build.\nMaking a system simpler does not necessarily mean reducing its functionality; it can\nalso mean removing accidental  complexity. Moseley and Marks [ 32] define complex\u2010\nity as accidental if it is not inherent in the problem that the software solves (as seen\nby the users) but arises only from the implementation.\nOne of the best tools we have for removing accidental complexity is abstraction . A\ngood abstraction can hide a great deal of implementation detail behind a clean,\nsimple-to-understand fa\u00e7ade. A good abstraction can also be used for a wide range of\ndifferent applications. Not only is this reuse more efficient than reimplementing a\nsimilar thing multiple times, but it also leads to higher-quality software, as quality\nimprovements in the abstracted component benefit all applications that use it.\nFor example, high-level programming languages are abstractions that hide machine\ncode, CPU registers, and syscalls. SQL is an abstraction that hides complex on-disk\nand in-memory data structures, concurrent requests from other clients, and inconsis\u2010\ntencies after crashes. Of course, when programming in a high-level language, we are\nstill using machine code; we are just not using it directly , because the programming\nlanguage abstraction saves us from having to think about it.\nHowever, finding good abstractions is very hard. In the field of distributed systems,\nalthough there are many good algorithms, it is much less clear how we should be\npackaging them into abstractions that help us keep the complexity of the system at a\nmanageable level.\nThroughout this book, we will keep our eyes open for good abstractions that allow us\nto extract parts of a large system into well-defined, reusable components.\nEvolvability: Making Change Easy\nIt\u2019s extremely unlikely that your system\u2019s requirements will remain unchanged for\u2010\never.

In this chapter we discussed reliability, scalability, and\nmaintainability in detail.\nReliability  means making systems work correctly, even when faults occur. Faults can\nbe in hardware (typically random and uncorrelated), software (bugs are typically sys\u2010\ntematic and hard to deal with), and humans (who inevitably make mistakes from\ntime to time). Fault-tolerance techniques can hide certain types of faults from the end\nuser.\nScalability  means having strategies for keeping performance good, even when load\nincreases. In order to discuss scalability, we first need ways of describing load and\nperformance quantitatively.

Much of what you see on the web today is still powered by\nrelational databases, be it online publishing, discussion, social networking, ecom\u2010\nmerce, games, software-as-a-service productivity applications, or much more.\nThe Birth of NoSQL\nNow, in the 2010s, NoSQL  is the latest attempt to overthrow the relational model\u2019s\ndominance.

Never\u2010\ntheless, the term struck a nerve and quickly spread through the web startup commu\u2010\nnity and beyond. A number of interesting database systems are now associated with\nthe #NoSQL hashtag, and it has been retroactively reinterpreted as Not Only SQL  [4].\nThere are several driving forces behind the adoption of NoSQL databases, including:\n\u2022A need for greater scalability than relational databases can easily achieve, includ\u2010\ning very large datasets or very high write throughput\n\u2022A widespread preference for free and open source software over commercial\ndatabase products\n\u2022Specialized query operations that are not well supported by the relational model\n\u2022Frustration with the restrictiveness of relational schemas, and a desire for a more\ndynamic and expressive data model [ 5]\nDifferent applications have different requirements, and the best choice of technology\nfor one use case may well be different from the best choice for another use case.

It is still in use\nand maintained today, running on OS/390 on IBM mainframes [ 14].\nThe design of IMS used a fairly simple data model called the hierarchical model ,\nwhich has some remarkable similarities to the JSON model used by document data\u2010\nbases [ 2]. It represented all data as a tree of records nested within records, much like\nthe JSON structure of Figure 2-2 .\nLike document databases, IMS worked well for one-to-many relationships, but it\nmade many-to-many relationships difficult, and it didn\u2019t support joins. Developers\nhad to decide whether to duplicate (denormalize) data or to manually resolve refer\u2010\nences from one record to another. These problems of the 1960s and \u201970s were very\nmuch like the problems that developers are running into with document databases\ntoday [ 15].\nVarious solutions were proposed to solve the limitations of the hierarchical model.\nThe two most prominent were the relational model  (which became SQL, and took\nover the world) and the network model  (which initially had a large following but\neventually faded into obscurity). The \u201cgreat debate\u201d between these two camps lasted\nfor much of the 1970s [ 2].\nSince the problem that the two models were solving is still so relevant today, it\u2019s\nworth briefly revisiting this debate in today\u2019s light.\nThe network model\nThe network model was standardized by a committee called the Conference on Data\nSystems Languages (CODASYL) and implemented by several different database ven\u2010\ndors; it is also known as the CODASYL model  [16].\nThe CODASYL model was a generalization of the hierarchical model. In the tree\nstructure of the hierarchical model, every record has exactly one parent; in the net\u2010\nwork model, a record could have multiple parents. For example, there could be one\nrecord for the \"Greater Seattle Area\"  region, and every user who lived in that\nregion could be linked to it.

Even with constraints, joins on foreign keys are performed at query time, whereas in\nCODASYL, the join was effectively done at insert time.The links between records in the network model were not foreign keys, but more like\npointers in a programming language (while still being stored on disk). The only way\nof accessing a record was to follow a path from a root record along these chains of\nlinks. This was called an access path .\nIn the simplest case, an access path could be like the traversal of a linked list: start at\nthe head of the list, and look at one record at a time until you find the one you want.\nBut in a world of many-to-many relationships, several different paths can lead to the\nsame record, and a programmer working with the network model had to keep track\nof these different access paths in their head.\nA query in CODASYL was performed by moving a cursor through the database by\niterating over lists of records and following access paths. If a record had multiple\nparents (i.e., multiple incoming pointers from other records), the application code\nhad to keep track of all the various relationships. Even CODASYL committee mem\u2010\nbers admitted that this was like navigating around an n-dimensional data space [ 17].\nAlthough manual access path selection was able to make the most efficient use of the\nvery limited hardware capabilities in the 1970s (such as tape drives, whose seeks are\nextremely slow), the problem was that they made the code for querying and updating\nthe database complicated and inflexible.

To date,\ndocument databases have not followed the path of CODASYL.\nRelational Versus Document Databases Today\nThere are many differences to consider when comparing relational databases to\ndocument databases, including their fault-tolerance properties (see Chapter 5 ) and\nhandling of concurrency (see Chapter 7 ). In this chapter, we will concentrate only on\nthe differences in the data model.\nThe main arguments in favor of the document data model are schema flexibility, bet\u2010\nter performance due to locality, and that for some applications it is closer to the data\nstructures used by the application. The relational model counters by providing better\nsupport for joins, and many-to-one and many-to-many relationships.\nWhich data model leads to simpler application code?\nIf the data in your application has a document-like structure (i.e., a tree of one-to-\nmany relationships, where typically the entire tree is loaded at once), then it\u2019s proba\u2010\n38 | Chapter 2: Data Models and Query Languages",

It is based on the map (also\nknown as collect ) and reduce  (also known as fold  or inject ) functions that exist\nin many functional programming languages.\nTo give an example, imagine you are a marine biologist, and you add an observation\nrecord to your database every time you see animals in the ocean. Now you want to\ngenerate a report saying how many sharks you have sighted per month.\nIn PostgreSQL you might express that query like this:\nSELECT date_trunc ('month', observation_timestamp ) AS observation_month , \n       sum(num_animals ) AS total_animals\nFROM observations\nWHERE family = 'Sharks'\nGROUP BY observation_month ;\nThe date_trunc('month', timestamp)  function determines the calendar month\ncontaining timestamp , and returns another timestamp representing the begin\u2010\nning of that month. In other words, it rounds a timestamp down to the nearest\nmonth.\nThis query first filters the observations to only show species in the Sharks  family,\nthen groups the observations by the calendar month in which they occurred, and\nfinally adds up the number of animals seen in all observations in that month.\nThe same can be expressed with MongoDB\u2019s MapReduce feature as follows:\n46 | Chapter 2: Data Models and Query Languages",

This is a good example of a data engineering task where understanding the tradeoffs between batch processing versus streaming depends on the specific requirements - in this case, we\u2019re prioritizing a simple aggregation, but it's important to recognize that more complex aggregations might necessitate a streaming architecture.\u201d",

However, they are nevertheless pow\u2010\nerful: they can parse strings, call library functions, perform calculations, and more.\nMapReduce is a fairly low-level programming model for distributed execution on a\ncluster of machines. Higher-level query languages like SQL can be implemented as a\npipeline of MapReduce operations (see Chapter 10 ), but there are also many dis\u2010\ntributed implementations of SQL that don\u2019t use MapReduce. Note there is nothing in\nSQL that constrains it to running on a single machine, and MapReduce doesn\u2019t have\na monopoly on distributed query execution.\nBeing able to use JavaScript code in the middle of a query is a great feature for\nadvanced queries, but it\u2019s not limited to MapReduce\u2014some SQL databases can be\nextended with JavaScript functions too [ 34].\nA usability problem with MapReduce is that you have to write two carefully coordi\u2010\nnated JavaScript functions, which is often harder than writing a single query. More\u2010\nover, a declarative query language offers more opportunities for a query optimizer to\nimprove the performance of a query. For these reasons, MongoDB 2.2 added support\nfor a declarative query language called the aggregation pipeline  [9]. In this language,\nthe same shark-counting query looks like this:\ndb.observations .aggregate ([\n    { $match: { family: \"Sharks\"  } },\n    { $group: {\n        _id: {\n            year:  { $year:  \"$observationTimestamp\"  },\n            month: { $month: \"$observationTimestamp\"  }\n        },\n        totalAnimals : { $sum: \"$numAnimals\"  }\n    } }\n]);\nThe aggregation pipeline language is similar in expressiveness to a subset of SQL, but\nit uses a JSON-based syntax rather than SQL\u2019s English-sentence-style syntax; the dif\u2010\nference is perhaps a matter of taste.

If your application has mostly one-to-many rela\u2010\ntionships (tree-structured data) or no relationships between records, the document\nmodel is appropriate.\nBut what if many-to-many relationships are very common in your data? The rela\u2010\ntional model can handle simple cases of many-to-many relationships, but as the con\u2010\nnections within your data become more complex, it becomes more natural to start\nmodeling your data as a graph.\nA graph consists of two kinds of objects: vertices  (also known as nodes  or entities ) and\nedges  (also known as relationships  or arcs). Many kinds of data can be modeled as a\ngraph. Typical examples include:\nSocial graphs\nVertices are people, and edges indicate which people know each other.\nThe web graph\nVertices are web pages, and edges indicate HTML links to other pages.\nRoad or rail networks\nVertices are junctions, and edges represent the roads or railway lines between\nthem.\nWell-known algorithms can operate on these graphs: for example, car navigation sys\u2010\ntems search for the shortest path between two points in a road network, and\nPageRank  can be used on the web graph to determine the popularity of a web page\nand thus its ranking in search results.\nIn the examples just given, all the vertices in a graph represent the same kind of thing\n(people, web pages, or road junctions, respectively).

In a graph database, there is no such\nrestriction: any vertex can have an edge to any other vertex. This gives much\ngreater flexibility for applications to adapt to changing requirements.\n\u2022In CODASYL, the only way to reach a particular record was to traverse one of\nthe access paths to it. In a graph database, you can refer directly to any vertex by\nits unique ID, or you can use an index to find vertices with a particular value.\n\u2022In CODASYL, the children of a record were an ordered set, so the database had\nto maintain that ordering (which had consequences for the storage layout) and\napplications that inserted new records into the database had to worry about the\npositions of the new records in these sets. In a graph database, vertices and edges\nare not ordered (you can only sort the results when making a query).\n\u2022In CODASYL, all queries were imperative, difficult to write and easily broken by\nchanges in the schema. In a graph database, you can write your traversal in\nimperative code if you want to, but most graph databases also support high-level,\ndeclarative query languages such as Cypher or SPARQL.\nThe Foundation: Datalog\nDatalog  is a much older language than SPARQL or Cypher, having been studied\nextensively by academics in the 1980s [ 44, 45, 46].

In this chapter we discuss the same from\nthe database\u2019s point of view: how we can store the data that we\u2019re given, and how we\ncan find it again when we\u2019re asked for it.\nWhy should you, as an application developer, care how the database handles storage\nand retrieval internally? You\u2019re probably not going to implement your own storage\nengine from scratch, but you do need to select a storage engine that is appropriate for\nyour application, from the many that are available. In order to tune a storage engine\nto perform well on your kind of workload, you need to have a rough idea of what the\nstorage engine is doing under the hood.\nIn particular, there is a big difference between storage engines that are optimized for\ntransactional workloads and those that are optimized for analytics. We will explore\nthat distinction later in \u201cTransaction Processing or Analytics?\u201d on page 90, and in\n\u201cColumn-Oriented Storage\u201d on page 95 we\u2019ll discuss a family of storage engines that\nis optimized for analytics.\nHowever, first we\u2019ll start this chapter by talking about storage engines that are used in\nthe kinds of databases that you\u2019re probably familiar with: traditional relational data\u2010\nbases, and also most so-called NoSQL databases.

Conversely, an analytics engine, like a columnar database, is optimized for fast aggregation and analysis of large datasets, often sacrificing some transactional guarantees for speed.  Choosing the right engine is a critical trade-off; a misaligned engine can lead to poor performance and potential data inconsistencies.

    "chunk": "Our db_set  function actually has pretty good performance for something that is so\nsimple, because appending to a file is generally very efficient. Similarly to what\ndb_set  does, many databases internally use a log, which is an append-only data file.\nReal databases have more issues to deal with (such as concurrency control, reclaim\u2010\ning disk space so that the log doesn\u2019t grow forever, and handling errors and partially\nwritten records), but the basic principle is the same. Logs are incredibly useful, and\nwe will encounter them several times in the rest of this book.\nThe word log is often used to refer to application logs, where an\napplication outputs text that describes what\u2019s happening. In this\nbook, log is used in the more general sense: an append-only\nsequence of records. It doesn\u2019t have to be human-readable; it might\nbe binary and intended only for other programs to read.\nOn the other hand, our db_get  function has terrible performance if you have a large\nnumber of records in your database. Every time you want to look up a key, db_get\nhas to scan the entire database file from beginning to end, looking for occurrences of\nthe key. In algorithmic terms, the cost of a lookup is O(n): if you double the number\nof records n in your database, a lookup takes twice as long. That\u2019s not good.\nIn order to efficiently find the value for a particular key in the database, we need a\ndifferent data structure: an index . In this chapter we will look at a range of indexing\nstructures and see how they compare; the general idea behind them is to keep some\nadditional metadata on the side, which acts as a signpost and helps you to locate the\ndata you want. If you want to search the same data in several different ways, you may\nneed several different indexes on different parts of the data.\nAn index is an additional  structure that is derived from the primary data. Many data\u2010\nbases allow you to add and remove indexes, and this doesn\u2019t affect the contents of the\ndatabase; it only affects the performance of queries. Maintaining additional structures\nincurs overhead, especially on writes. For writes, it\u2019s hard to beat the performance of\nsimply appending to a file, because that\u2019s the simplest possible write operation. Any\nkind of index usually slows down writes, because the index also needs to be updated\nevery time data is written.\nThis is an important trade-off in storage systems: well-chosen indexes speed up read\nqueries, but every index slows down writes. For this reason, databases don\u2019t usually\nindex everything by default, but require you\u2014the application developer or database\nadministrator\u2014to choose indexes manually, using your knowledge of the applica\u2010\ntion\u2019s typical query patterns. You can then choose the indexes that give your applica\u2010\ntion the greatest benefit, without introducing more overhead than necessary.\nData Structures That Power Your Database | 71",

The key here is recognizing that different workloads necessitate different strategies.  We\u2019re seeing a classic example of a read-heavy versus write-heavy scenario.  It\u2019s crucial for data engineers to understand how queries will be used to determine if an index is actually beneficial; blindly adding indexes will always introduce overhead.

This is not the only kind of data you can\nindex, but it\u2019s very common, and it\u2019s a useful building block for more complex\nindexes.\nKey-value stores are quite similar to the dictionary  type that you can find in most\nprogramming languages, and which is usually implemented as a hash map (hash\ntable). Hash maps are described in many algorithms textbooks [ 1, 2], so we won\u2019t go\ninto detail of how they work here. Since we already have hash maps for our in-\nmemory data structures, why not use them to index our data on disk?\nLet\u2019s say our data storage consists only of appending to a file, as in the preceding\nexample. Then the simplest possible indexing strategy is this: keep an in-memory\nhash map where every key is mapped to a byte offset in the data file\u2014the location at\nwhich the value can be found, as illustrated in Figure 3-1 . Whenever you append a\nnew key-value pair to the file, you also update the hash map to reflect the offset of the\ndata you just wrote (this works both for inserting new keys and for updating existing\nkeys). When you want to look up a value, use the hash map to find the offset in the\ndata file, seek to that location, and read the value.\nFigure 3-1. Storing a log of key-value pairs in a CSV-like format, indexed with an in-\nmemory hash map.\nThis may sound simplistic, but it is a viable approach.

There are plenty of well-known tree data\nstructures that you can use, such as red-black trees or AVL trees [ 2].

Storage engines that are based on this principle of\nmerging and compacting sorted files are often called LSM storage engines.\nLucene, an indexing engine for full-text search used by Elasticsearch and Solr, uses a\nsimilar method for storing its term dictionary  [12, 13]. A full-text index is much more\ncomplex than a key-value index but is based on a similar idea: given a word in a\nsearch query, find all the documents (web pages, product descriptions, etc.) that\nmention the word. This is implemented with a key-value structure where the key is a\nword (a term ) and the value is the list of IDs of all the documents that contain the\nword (the postings list ). In Lucene, this mapping from term to postings list is kept in\nSSTable-like sorted files, which are merged in the background as needed [ 14].\nPerformance optimizations\nAs always, a lot of detail goes into making a storage engine perform well in practice.\nFor example, the LSM-tree algorithm can be slow when looking up keys that do not\nexist in the database: you have to check the memtable, then the segments all the way\nback to the oldest (possibly having to read from disk for each one) before you can be\nsure that the key does not exist. In order to optimize this kind of access, storage\nengines often use additional Bloom filters  [15]. (A Bloom filter is a memory-efficient\ndata structure for approximating the contents of a set. It can tell you if a key does not\nappear in the database, and thus saves many unnecessary disk reads for nonexistent\nkeys.)\nThere are also different strategies to determine the order and timing of how SSTables\nare compacted and merged. The most common options are size-tiered  and leveled\ncompaction. LevelDB and RocksDB use leveled compaction (hence the name of Lev\u2010\nelDB), HBase uses size-tiered, and Cassandra supports both [ 16]. In size-tiered com\u2010\npaction, newer and smaller SSTables are successively merged into older and larger\nSSTables. In leveled compaction, the key range is split up into smaller SSTables and\nolder data is moved into separate \u201clevels,\u201d which allows the compaction to proceed\nmore incrementally and use less disk space.\nEven though there are many subtleties, the basic idea of LSM-trees\u2014keeping a cas\u2010\ncade of SSTables that are merged in the background\u2014is simple and effective. Even\nwhen the dataset is much bigger than the available memory it continues to work well.\nSince data is stored in sorted order, you can efficiently perform range queries (scan\u2010\nning all keys above some minimum and up to some maximum), and because the disk\nwrites are sequential the LSM-tree can support remarkably high write throughput. \nB-Trees\nThe log-structured indexes we have discussed so far are gaining acceptance, but they\nare not the most common type of index.

This is a dangerous operation, because if the data\u2010\nbase crashes after only some of the pages have been written, you end up with a cor\u2010\nrupted index (e.g., there may be an orphan  page that is not a child of any parent).\nIn order to make the database resilient to crashes, it is common for B-tree implemen\u2010\ntations to include an additional data structure on disk: a write-ahead log  (WAL, also\nknown as a redo log ). This is an append-only file to which every B-tree modification\nmust be written before it can be applied to the pages of the tree itself. When the data\u2010\nbase comes back up after a crash, this log is used to restore the B-tree back to a con\u2010\nsistent state [ 5, 20].\nAn additional complication of updating pages in place is that careful concurrency\ncontrol is required if multiple threads are going to access the B-tree at the same time\n\u2014otherwise a thread may see the tree in an inconsistent state. This is typically done\nby protecting the tree\u2019s data structures with latches  (lightweight locks). Log-\nstructured approaches are simpler in this regard, because they do all the merging in\nthe background without interfering with incoming queries and atomically swap old\nsegments for new segments from time to time.\nB-tree optimizations\nAs B-trees have been around for so long, it\u2019s not surprising that many optimizations\nhave been developed over the years. To mention just a few:\n\u2022Instead of overwriting pages and maintaining a WAL for crash recovery, some\ndatabases (like LMDB) use a copy-on-write scheme [ 21]. A modified page is\nwritten to a different location, and a new version of the parent pages in the tree is\ncreated, pointing at the new location.

Some storage engines even overwrite the same page twice in order\nto avoid ending up with a partially updated page in the event of a power failure [ 24,\n25].\nLog-structured indexes also rewrite data multiple times due to repeated compaction\nand merging of SSTables. This effect\u2014one write to the database resulting in multiple\nwrites to the disk over the course of the database\u2019s lifetime\u2014is known as write ampli\u2010\nfication . It is of particular concern on SSDs, which can only overwrite blocks a limi\u2010\nted number of times before wearing out.\nIn write-heavy applications, the performance bottleneck might be the rate at which\nthe database can write to disk. In this case, write amplification has a direct perfor\u2010\nmance cost: the more that a storage engine writes to disk, the fewer writes per second\nit can handle within the available disk bandwidth.\nMoreover, LSM-trees are typically able to sustain higher write throughput than B-\ntrees, partly because they sometimes have lower write amplification (although this\ndepends on the storage engine configuration and workload), and partly because they\nsequentially write compact SSTable files rather than having to overwrite several pages\nin the tree [ 26]. This difference is particularly important on magnetic hard drives,\nwhere sequential writes are much faster than random writes.\nLSM-trees can be compressed better, and thus often produce smaller files on disk\nthan B-trees. B-tree storage engines leave some disk space unused due to fragmenta\u2010\ntion: when a page is split or when a row cannot fit into an existing page, some space\nin a page remains unused. Since LSM-trees are not page-oriented and periodically\nrewrite SSTables to remove fragmentation, they have lower storage overheads, espe\u2010\ncially when using leveled compaction [ 27].\nOn many SSDs, the firmware internally uses a log-structured algorithm to turn ran\u2010\ndom writes into sequential writes on the underlying storage chips, so the impact of\nthe storage engine\u2019s write pattern is less pronounced [ 19]. However, lower write\namplification and reduced fragmentation are still advantageous on SSDs: represent\u2010\ning data more compactly allows more read and write requests within the available I/O\nbandwidth.\nDownsides of LSM-trees\nA downside of log-structured storage is that the compaction process can sometimes\ninterfere with the performance of ongoing reads and writes.

When\nwriting to an empty database, the full disk bandwidth can be used for the initial write,\nbut the bigger the database gets, the more disk bandwidth is required for compaction.\nIf write throughput is high and compaction is not configured carefully, it can happen\nthat compaction cannot keep up with the rate of incoming writes. In this case, the\nnumber of unmerged segments on disk keeps growing until you run out of disk\nspace, and reads also slow down because they need to check more segment files.

The main differ\u2010\nence is that keys are not unique; i.e., there might be many rows (documents, vertices)\nwith the same key. This can be solved in two ways: either by making each value in the\nindex a list of matching row identifiers (like a postings list in a full-text index) or by\nmaking each key unique by appending a row identifier to it. Either way, both B-trees\nand log-structured indexes can be used as secondary indexes.\nStoring values within the index\nThe key in an index is the thing that queries search for, but the value can be one of\ntwo things: it could be the actual row (document, vertex) in question, or it could be a\nreference to the row stored elsewhere. In the latter case, the place where rows are\nstored is known as a heap file , and it stores data in no particular order (it may be\nappend-only, or it may keep track of deleted rows in order to overwrite them with\nnew data later). The heap file approach is common because it avoids duplicating data\nwhen multiple secondary indexes are present: each index just references a location in\nthe heap file, and the actual data is kept in one place.\nWhen updating a value without changing the key, the heap file approach can be quite\nefficient: the record can be overwritten in place, provided that the new value is not\nlarger than the old value. The situation is more complicated if the new value is larger,\nas it probably needs to be moved to a new location in the heap where there is enough\nspace. In that case, either all indexes need to be updated to point at the new heap\nlocation of the record, or a forwarding pointer is left behind in the old heap location\n[5].\nIn some situations, the extra hop from the index to the heap file is too much of a per\u2010\nformance penalty for reads, so it can be desirable to store the indexed row directly\nwithin an index. This is known as a clustered index . For example, in MySQL\u2019s\nInnoDB storage engine, the primary key of a table is always a clustered index, and\nsecondary indexes refer to the primary key (rather than a heap file location) [ 31].

That is not sufficient if\nwe need to query multiple columns of a table (or multiple fields in a document)\nsimultaneously.\nThe most common type of multi-column index is called a concatenated index , which\nsimply combines several fields into one key by appending one column to another (the\nindex definition specifies in which order the fields are concatenated).

Transaction processing\njust means allowing clients to make low-latency reads and writes\u2014\nas opposed to batch processing  jobs, which only run periodically\n(for example, once per day).

An application\ntypically looks up a small number of records by some key, using an index. Records\nare inserted or updated based on the user\u2019s input. Because these applications are\ninteractive, the access pattern became known as online transaction processing\n(OLTP).\nHowever, databases also started being increasingly used for data analytics , which has\nvery different access patterns. Usually an analytic query needs to scan over a huge\nnumber of records, only reading a few columns per record, and calculates aggregate\nstatistics (such as count, sum, or average) rather than returning the raw data to the\nuser.

    "chunk": "Note that it wouldn\u2019t make sense to sort each column independently, because then\nwe would no longer know which items in the columns belong to the same row. We\ncan only reconstruct a row because we know that the kth item in one column belongs\nto the same row as the kth item in another column.\nRather, the data needs to be sorted an entire row at a time, even though it is stored by\ncolumn. The administrator of the database can choose the columns by which the\ntable should be sorted, using their knowledge of common queries. For example, if\nqueries often target date ranges, such as the last month, it might make sense to make\ndate_key  the first sort key. Then the query optimizer can scan only the rows from the\nlast month, which will be much faster than scanning all rows.\nA second column can determine the sort order of any rows that have the same value\nin the first column. For example, if date_key  is the first sort key in Figure 3-10 , it\nmight make sense for product_sk  to be the second sort key so that all sales for the\nsame product on the same day are grouped together in storage. That will help queries\nthat need to group or filter sales by product within a certain date range.\nAnother advantage of sorted order is that it can help with compression of columns. If\nthe primary sort column does not have many distinct values, then after sorting, it will\nhave long sequences where the same value is repeated many times in a row. A simple\nrun-length encoding, like we used for the bitmaps in Figure 3-11 , could compress\nthat column down to a few kilobytes\u2014even if the table has billions of rows.\nThat compression effect is strongest on the first sort key. The second and third sort\nkeys will be more jumbled up, and thus not have such long runs of repeated values.\nColumns further down the sorting priority appear in essentially random order, so\nthey probably won\u2019t compress as well. But having the first few columns sorted is still\na win overall.\nSeveral different sort orders\nA clever extension of this idea was introduced in C-Store and adopted in the com\u2010\nmercial data warehouse Vertica [ 61, 62]. Different queries benefit from different sort\norders, so why not store the same data sorted in several different  ways? Data needs to\nbe replicated to multiple machines anyway, so that you don\u2019t lose data if one machine\nfails. You might as well store that redundant data sorted in different ways so that\nwhen you\u2019re processing a query, you can use the version that best fits the query\npattern.\nHaving multiple sort orders in a column-oriented store is a bit similar to having mul\u2010\ntiple secondary indexes in a row-oriented store. But the big difference is that the row-\noriented store keeps every row in one place (in the heap file or a clustered index), and\nsecondary indexes just contain pointers to the matching rows. In a column store,\nthere normally aren\u2019t any pointers to data elsewhere, only columns containing values. \n100 | Chapter 3: Storage and Retrieval",

    "chunk": "Writing to Column-Oriented Storage\nThese optimizations make sense in data warehouses, because most of the load con\u2010\nsists of large read-only queries run by analysts. Column-oriented storage, compres\u2010\nsion, and sorting all help to make those read queries faster. However, they have the\ndownside of making writes more difficult.\nAn update-in-place approach, like B-trees use, is not possible with compressed col\u2010\numns. If you wanted to insert a row in the middle of a sorted table, you would most\nlikely have to rewrite all the column files. As rows are identified by their position\nwithin a column, the insertion has to update all columns consistently.\nFortunately, we have already seen a good solution earlier in this chapter: LSM-trees.\nAll writes first go to an in-memory store, where they are added to a sorted structure\nand prepared for writing to disk. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the in-memory store is\nrow-oriented or column-oriented. When enough writes have accumulated, they are\nmerged with the column files on disk and written to new files in bulk. This is essen\u2010\ntially what Vertica does [ 62].\nQueries need to examine both the column data on disk and the recent writes in mem\u2010\nory, and combine the two. However, the query optimizer hides this distinction from\nthe user. From an analyst\u2019s point of view, data that has been modified with inserts,\nupdates, or deletes is immediately reflected in subsequent queries. \nAggregation: Data Cubes and Materialized Views\nNot every data warehouse is necessarily a column store: traditional row-oriented\ndatabases and a few other architectures are also used. However, columnar storage can\nbe significantly faster for ad hoc analytical queries, so it is rapidly gaining popularity\n[51, 63].\nAnother aspect of data warehouses that is worth mentioning briefly is materialized\naggregates . As discussed earlier, data warehouse queries often involve an aggregate\nfunction, such as COUNT , SUM, AVG, MIN, or MAX in SQL. If the same aggregates are used\nby many different queries, it can be wasteful to crunch through the raw data every\ntime. Why not cache some of the counts or sums that queries use most often?\nOne way of creating such a cache is a materialized view . In a relational data model, it\nis often defined like a standard (virtual) view: a table-like object whose contents are\nthe results of some query. The difference is that a materialized view is an actual copy\nof the query results, written to disk, whereas a virtual view is just a shortcut for writ\u2010\ning queries. When you read from a virtual view, the SQL engine expands it into the\nview\u2019s underlying query on the fly and then processes the expanded query.\nWhen the underlying data changes, a materialized view needs to be updated, because\nit is a denormalized copy of the data. The database can do that automatically, but\nColumn-Oriented Storage | 101",

From a data engineering perspective, we need to understand how these write performance characteristics will impact our data pipeline design, potentially influencing our choice of technologies and data models.

What happens when you store data in a database, and what does the data\u2010\nbase do when you query for the data again later?\nOn a high level, we saw that storage engines fall into two broad categories: those opti\u2010\nmized for transaction processing (OLTP), and those optimized for analytics (OLAP).\nThere are big differences between the access patterns in those use cases:\n\u2022OLTP systems are typically user-facing, which means that they may see a huge\nvolume of requests. In order to handle the load, applications usually only touch a\nsmall number of records in each query. The application requests records using\nsome kind of key, and the storage engine uses an index to find the data for the\nrequested key. Disk seek time is often the bottleneck here.\n\u2022Data warehouses and similar analytic systems are less well known, because they\nare primarily used by business analysts, not by end users. They handle a much\nlower volume of queries than OLTP systems, but each query is typically very\ndemanding, requiring many millions of records to be scanned in a short time.\nDisk bandwidth (not seek time) is often the bottleneck here, and column-\noriented storage is an increasingly popular solution for this kind of workload.\nOn the OLTP side, we saw storage engines from two main schools of thought:\n\u2022The log-structured school, which only permits appending to files and deleting\nobsolete files, but never updates a file that has been written. Bitcask, SSTables,\nLSM-trees, LevelDB, Cassandra, HBase, Lucene, and others belong to this group.\n\u2022The update-in-place school, which treats the disk as a set of fixed-size pages that\ncan be overwritten. B-trees are the biggest example of this philosophy, being used\nin all major relational databases and also many nonrelational ones.\nLog-structured storage engines are a comparatively recent development. Their key\nidea is that they systematically turn random-access writes into sequential writes on\ndisk, which enables higher write throughput due to the performance characteristics\nof hard drives and SSDs.\nSummary | 103",

In Chapter 1  we introduced the idea of evolvability : we should\naim to build systems that make it easy to adapt to change (see \u201cEvolvability: Making\nChange Easy\u201d on page 21 ).\nIn most cases, a change to an application\u2019s features also requires a change to data that\nit stores: perhaps a new field or record type needs to be captured, or perhaps existing\ndata needs to be presented in a new way.\nThe data models we discussed in Chapter 2  have different ways of coping with such\nchange. Relational databases generally assume that all data in the database conforms\nto one schema: although that schema can be changed (through schema migrations;\ni.e., ALTER  statements), there is exactly one schema in force at any one point in time.\nBy contrast, schema-on-read (\u201cschemaless\u201d) databases don\u2019t enforce a schema, so the\ndatabase can contain a mixture of older and newer data formats written at different\ntimes (see \u201cSchema flexibility in the document model\u201d on page 39 ).\nWhen a data format or schema changes, a corresponding change to application code\noften needs to happen (for example, you add a new field to a record, and the applica\u2010\ntion code starts reading and writing that field).

However, they also have a\nnumber of deep problems:\n\u2022The encoding is often tied to a particular programming language, and reading\nthe data in another language is very difficult. If you store or transmit data in such\nan encoding, you are committing yourself to your current programming lan\u2010\nguage for potentially a very long time, and precluding integrating your systems\nwith those of other organizations (which may use different languages).\n\u2022In order to restore data in the same object types, the decoding process needs to\nbe able to instantiate arbitrary classes. This is frequently a source of security\nproblems [ 5]: if an attacker can get your application to decode an arbitrary byte\nsequence, they can instantiate arbitrary classes, which in turn often allows them\nto do terrible things such as remotely executing arbitrary code [ 6, 7].\nFormats for Encoding Data | 113",

For example, Java\u2019s built-in serialization\nis notorious for its bad performance and bloated encoding [ 8].\nFor these reasons it\u2019s generally a bad idea to use your language\u2019s built-in encoding for\nanything other than very transient purposes.\nJSON, XML, and Binary Variants\nMoving to standardized encodings that can be written and read by many program\u2010\nming languages, JSON and XML are the obvious contenders. They are widely known,\nwidely supported, and almost as widely disliked. XML is often criticized for being too\nverbose and unnecessarily complicated [ 9]. JSON\u2019s popularity is mainly due to its\nbuilt-in support in web browsers (by virtue of being a subset of JavaScript) and sim\u2010\nplicity relative to XML. CSV is another popular language-independent format, albeit\nless powerful.\nJSON, XML, and CSV are textual formats, and thus somewhat human-readable\n(although the syntax is a popular topic of debate). Besides the superficial syntactic\nissues, they also have some subtle problems:\n\u2022There is a lot of ambiguity around the encoding of numbers. In XML and CSV,\nyou cannot distinguish between a number and a string that happens to consist of\ndigits (except by referring to an external schema). JSON distinguishes strings and\nnumbers, but it doesn\u2019t distinguish integers and floating-point numbers, and it\ndoesn\u2019t specify a precision.\nThis is a problem when dealing with large numbers; for example, integers greater\nthan 253 cannot be exactly represented in an IEEE 754 double-precision floating-\npoint number, so such numbers become inaccurate when parsed in a language\nthat uses floating-point numbers (such as JavaScript). An example of numbers\nlarger than 253 occurs on Twitter, which uses a 64-bit number to identify each\ntweet. The JSON returned by Twitter\u2019s API includes tweet IDs twice, once as a\nJSON number and once as a decimal string, to work around the fact that the\nnumbers are not correctly parsed by JavaScript applications [ 10].\n\u2022JSON and XML have good support for Unicode character strings (i.e., human-\nreadable text), but they don\u2019t support binary strings (sequences of bytes without\na character encoding). Binary strings are a useful feature, so people get around\nthis limitation by encoding the binary data as text using Base64. The schema is\nthen used to indicate that the value should be interpreted as Base64-encoded.\nThis works, but it\u2019s somewhat hacky and increases the data size by 33%.\n114 | Chapter 4: Encoding and Evolution",

Since the correct interpretation of data (such\nas numbers and binary strings) depends on information in the schema, applica\u2010\ntions that don\u2019t use XML/JSON schemas need to potentially hardcode the appro\u2010\npriate encoding/decoding logic instead.\n\u2022CSV does not have any schema, so it is up to the application to define the mean\u2010\ning of each row and column. If an application change adds a new row or column,\nyou have to handle that change manually. CSV is also a quite vague format (what\nhappens if a value contains a comma or a newline character?). Although its\nescaping rules have been formally specified [ 13], not all parsers implement them\ncorrectly.\nDespite these flaws, JSON, XML, and CSV are good enough for many purposes.

There may just be a single process\naccessing the database, in which case the reader is simply a later version of the same\nprocess\u2014in that case you can think of storing something in the database as sending a\nmessage to your future self .\nBackward compatibility is clearly necessary here; otherwise your future self won\u2019t be\nable to decode what you previously wrote.\nIn general, it\u2019s common for several different processes to be accessing a database at\nthe same time. Those processes might be several different applications or services, or\nthey may simply be several instances of the same service (running in parallel for scal\u2010\nability or fault tolerance). Either way, in an environment where the application is\nchanging, it is likely that some processes accessing the database will be running newer\ncode and some will be running older code\u2014for example because a new version is cur\u2010\nrently being deployed in a rolling upgrade, so some instances have been updated\nwhile others haven\u2019t yet.\nThis means that a value in the database may be written by a newer  version of the\ncode, and subsequently read by an older  version of the code that is still running.\nThus, forward compatibility is also often required for databases.\nHowever, there is an additional snag. Say you add a field to a record schema, and the\nnewer code writes a value for that new field to the database. Subsequently, an older\nversion of the code (which doesn\u2019t yet know about the new field) reads the record,\nupdates it, and writes it back. In this situation, the desirable behavior is usually for\nthe old code to keep the new field intact, even though it couldn\u2019t be interpreted.\nThe encoding formats discussed previously support such preservation of unknown\nfields, but sometimes you need to take care at an application level, as illustrated in\nFigure 4-7 . For example, if you decode a database value into model objects in the\napplication, and later reencode those model objects, the unknown field might be lost\nin that translation process. Solving this is not a hard problem; you just need to be\naware of it.\nModes of Dataflow | 129",

This way of building applications has traditionally been called a service-\noriented architecture  (SOA), more recently refined and rebranded as microservices\narchitecture  [31, 32].\nIn some ways, services are similar to databases: they typically allow clients to submit\nand query data.

REST has been gaining popularity compared to SOAP, at least in\nthe context of cross-organizational service integration [ 36], and is often associated\nwith microservices [ 31]. An API designed according to the principles of REST is\ncalled RESTful .\nBy contrast, SOAP is an XML-based protocol for making network API requests.vii\nAlthough it is most commonly used over HTTP, it aims to be independent from\nHTTP and avoids using most HTTP features. Instead, it comes with a sprawling and\ncomplex multitude of related standards (the web service framework , known as WS-* )\nthat add various features [ 37].\nThe API of a SOAP web service is described using an XML-based language called the\nWeb Services Description Language, or WSDL. WSDL enables code generation so\nthat a client can access a remote service using local classes and method calls (which\nare encoded to XML messages and decoded again by the framework). This is useful in\nstatically typed programming languages, but less so in dynamically typed ones (see\n\u201cCode generation and dynamically typed languages\u201d on page 127 ).\nAs WSDL is not designed to be human-readable, and as SOAP messages are often too\ncomplex to construct manually, users of SOAP rely heavily on tool support, code\ngeneration, and IDEs [ 38].

    "chunk": "For these reasons, REST seems to be the predominant style for public APIs. The main\nfocus of RPC frameworks is on requests between services owned by the same organi\u2010\nzation, typically within the same datacenter.\nData encoding and evolution for RPC\nFor evolvability, it is important that RPC clients and servers can be changed and\ndeployed independently. Compared to data flowing through databases (as described\nin the last section), we can make a simplifying assumption in the case of dataflow\nthrough services: it is reasonable to assume that all the servers will be updated first,\nand all the clients second. Thus, you only need backward compatibility on requests,\nand forward compatibility on responses.\nThe backward and forward compatibility properties of an RPC scheme are inherited\nfrom whatever encoding it uses:\n\u2022Thrift, gRPC (Protocol Buffers), and Avro RPC can be evolved according to the\ncompatibility rules of the respective encoding format.\n\u2022In SOAP, requests and responses are specified with XML schemas. These can be\nevolved, but there are some subtle pitfalls [ 47].\n\u2022RESTful APIs most commonly use JSON (without a formally specified schema)\nfor responses, and JSON or URI-encoded/form-encoded request parameters for\nrequests. Adding optional request parameters and adding new fields to response\nobjects are usually considered changes that maintain compatibility.\nService compatibility is made harder by the fact that RPC is often used for communi\u2010\ncation across organizational boundaries, so the provider of a service often has no\ncontrol over its clients and cannot force them to upgrade. Thus, compatibility needs\nto be maintained for a long time, perhaps indefinitely. If a compatibility-breaking\nchange is required, the service provider often ends up maintaining multiple versions\nof the service API side by side.\nThere is no agreement on how API versioning should work (i.e., how a client can\nindicate which version of the API it wants to use [ 48]). For RESTful APIs, common\napproaches are to use a version number in the URL or in the HTTP Accept  header.\nFor services that use API keys to identify a particular client, another option is to store\na client\u2019s requested API version on the server and to allow this version selection to be\nupdated through a separate administrative interface [ 49]. \nMessage-Passing Dataflow\nWe have been looking at the different ways encoded data flows from one process to\nanother. So far, we\u2019ve discussed REST and RPC (where one process sends a request\nover the network to another process and expects a response as quickly as possible),\n136 | Chapter 4: Encoding and Evolution",

    "chunk": "and databases (where one process writes encoded data, and another process reads it\nagain sometime in the future).\nIn this final section, we will briefly look at asynchronous message-passing  systems,\nwhich are somewhere between RPC and databases. They are similar to RPC in that a\nclient\u2019s request (usually called a message ) is delivered to another process with low\nlatency. They are similar to databases in that the message is not sent via a direct net\u2010\nwork connection, but goes via an intermediary called a message broker  (also called a\nmessage queue  or message-oriented middleware ), which stores the message temporar\u2010\nily.\nUsing a message broker has several advantages compared to direct RPC:\n\u2022It can act as a buffer if the recipient is unavailable or overloaded, and thus\nimprove system reliability.\n\u2022It can automatically redeliver messages to a process that has crashed, and thus\nprevent messages from being lost.\n\u2022It avoids the sender needing to know the IP address and port number of the\nrecipient (which is particularly useful in a cloud deployment where virtual\nmachines often come and go).\n\u2022It allows one message to be sent to several recipients.\n\u2022It logically decouples the sender from the recipient (the sender just publishes\nmessages and doesn\u2019t care who consumes them).\nHowever, a difference compared to RPC is that message-passing communication is\nusually one-way: a sender normally doesn\u2019t expect to receive a reply to its messages. It\nis possible for a process to send a response, but this would usually be done on a sepa\u2010\nrate channel. This communication pattern is asynchronous : the sender doesn\u2019t wait\nfor the message to be delivered, but simply sends it and then forgets about it.\nMessage brokers\nIn the past, the landscape of message brokers was dominated by commercial enter\u2010\nprise software from companies such as TIBCO, IBM WebSphere, and webMethods.\nMore recently, open source implementations such as RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, Hor\u2010\nnetQ, NATS, and Apache Kafka have become popular. We will compare them in\nmore detail in Chapter 11 .\nThe detailed delivery semantics vary by implementation and configuration, but in\ngeneral, message brokers are used as follows: one process sends a message to a named\nqueue  or topic , and the broker ensures that the message is delivered to one or more\nconsumers  of or subscribers  to that queue or topic. There can be many producers and\nmany consumers on the same topic.\nModes of Dataflow | 137",

From a reliability standpoint, using a message broker to decouple services is a really common and powerful pattern. The buffering effect is crucial \u2013 it prevents upstream services from being overwhelmed if downstream services are temporarily unavailable.  The broker's ability to redeliver messages upon process failure addresses a critical durability concern, and the asynchronous nature allows us to build more resilient, loosely coupled systems.

    "chunk": "A topic provides only one-way dataflow. However, a consumer may itself publish\nmessages to another topic (so you can chain them together, as we shall see in Chap\u2010\nter 11 ), or to a reply queue that is consumed by the sender of the original message\n(allowing a request/response dataflow, similar to RPC).\nMessage brokers typically don\u2019t enforce any particular data model\u2014a message is just\na sequence of bytes with some metadata, so you can use any encoding format. If the\nencoding is backward and forward compatible, you have the greatest flexibility to\nchange publishers and consumers independently and deploy them in any order.\nIf a consumer republishes messages to another topic, you may need to be careful to\npreserve unknown fields, to prevent the issue described previously in the context of\ndatabases ( Figure 4-7 ).\nDistributed actor frameworks\nThe actor model  is a programming model for concurrency in a single process. Rather\nthan dealing directly with threads (and the associated problems of race conditions,\nlocking, and deadlock), logic is encapsulated in actors . Each actor typically represents\none client or entity, it may have some local state (which is not shared with any other\nactor), and it communicates with other actors by sending and receiving asynchro\u2010\nnous messages. Message delivery is not guaranteed: in certain error scenarios, mes\u2010\nsages will be lost. Since each actor processes only one message at a time, it doesn\u2019t\nneed to worry about threads, and each actor can be scheduled independently by the\nframework.\nIn distributed actor frameworks , this programming model is used to scale an applica\u2010\ntion across multiple nodes. The same message-passing mechanism is used, no matter\nwhether the sender and recipient are on the same node or different nodes. If they are\non different nodes, the message is transparently encoded into a byte sequence, sent\nover the network, and decoded on the other side.\nLocation transparency works better in the actor model than in RPC, because the actor\nmodel already assumes that messages may be lost, even within a single process.\nAlthough latency over the network is likely higher than within the same process,\nthere is less of a fundamental mismatch between local and remote communication\nwhen using the actor model.\nA distributed actor framework essentially integrates a message broker and the actor\nprogramming model into a single framework. However, if you want to perform roll\u2010\ning upgrades of your actor-based application, you still have to worry about forward\nand backward compatibility, as messages may be sent from a node running the new\nversion to a node running the old version, and vice versa.\nThree popular distributed actor frameworks handle message encoding as follows:\n138 | Chapter 4: Encoding and Evolution",

For purposes of this book, the\ndifference isn\u2019t important.There are many trade-offs to consider with replication: for example, whether to use\nsynchronous or asynchronous replication, and how to handle failed replicas. Those\nare often configuration options in databases, and although the details vary by data\u2010\nbase, the general principles are similar across many different implementations. We\nwill discuss the consequences of such choices in this chapter.\nReplication of databases is an old topic\u2014the principles haven\u2019t changed much since\nthey were studied in the 1970s [ 1], because the fundamental constraints of networks\nhave remained the same. However, outside of research, many developers continued\nto assume for a long time that a database consisted of just one node. Mainstream use\nof distributed databases is more recent.

This process is called failover .\nFailover can happen manually (an administrator is notified that the leader has failed\nand takes the necessary steps to make a new leader) or automatically. An automatic\nfailover process usually consists of the following steps:\n1.Determining that the leader has failed.  There are many things that could poten\u2010\ntially go wrong: crashes, power outages, network issues, and more. There is no\nfoolproof way of detecting what has gone wrong, so most systems simply use a\ntimeout: nodes frequently bounce messages back and forth between each other,\nand if a node doesn\u2019t respond for some period of time\u2014say, 30 seconds\u2014it is\nassumed to be dead. (If the leader is deliberately taken down for planned mainte\u2010\nnance, this doesn\u2019t apply.)\n2.Choosing a new leader.  This could be done through an election process (where\nthe leader is chosen by a majority of the remaining replicas), or a new leader\ncould be appointed by a previously elected controller node . The best candidate for\nleadership is usually the replica with the most up-to-date data changes from the\nold leader (to minimize any data loss). Getting all the nodes to agree on a new\nleader is a consensus problem, discussed in detail in Chapter 9 .\n3.Reconfiguring the system to use the new leader.  Clients now need to send\ntheir write requests to the new leader (we discuss this in \u201cRequest Routing\u201d on\npage 214). If the old leader comes back, it might still believe that it is the leader,\nnot realizing that the other replicas have forced it to step down. The system\nneeds to ensure that the old leader becomes a follower and recognizes the new\nleader.\nFailover is fraught with things that can go wrong:\n\u2022If asynchronous replication is used, the new leader may not have received all the\nwrites from the old leader before it failed. If the former leader rejoins the cluster\nafter a new leader has been chosen, what should happen to those writes? The new\nleader may have received conflicting writes in the meantime.

This makes replica\u2010\ntion closely coupled to the storage engine. If the database changes its storage format\nfrom one version to another, it is typically not possible to run different versions of\nthe database software on the leader and the followers.\nThat may seem like a minor implementation detail, but it can have a big operational\nimpact. If the replication protocol allows the follower to use a newer software version\nthan the leader, you can perform a zero-downtime upgrade of the database software\nby first upgrading the followers and then performing a failover to make one of the\nupgraded nodes the new leader. If the replication protocol does not allow this version\nmismatch, as is often the case with WAL shipping, such upgrades require downtime.\nLogical (row-based) log replication\nAn alternative is to use different log formats for replication and for the storage\nengine, which allows the replication log to be decoupled from the storage engine\ninternals. This kind of replication log is called a logical log , to distinguish it from the\nstorage engine\u2019s ( physical ) data representation.\nA logical log for a relational database is usually a sequence of records describing\nwrites to database tables at the granularity of a row:\n\u2022For an inserted row, the log contains the new values of all columns.\n\u2022For a deleted row, the log contains enough information to uniquely identify the\nrow that was deleted.

MySQL\u2019s binlog (when\nconfigured to use row-based replication) uses this approach [ 17].\nSince a logical log is decoupled from the storage engine internals, it can more easily\nbe kept backward compatible, allowing the leader and the follower to run different\nversions of the database software, or even different storage engines.\nA logical log format is also easier for external applications to parse.

However, by doing so, you would lose the main advantage of multi-leader repli\u2010\ncation: allowing each replica to accept writes independently. If you want synchronous\nconflict detection, you might as well just use single-leader replication.\nConflict avoidance\nThe simplest strategy for dealing with conflicts is to avoid them: if the application can\nensure that all writes for a particular record go through the same leader, then con\u2010\nflicts cannot occur. Since many implementations of multi-leader replication handle\nconflicts quite poorly, avoiding conflicts is a frequently recommended approach [ 34].\nFor example, in an application where a user can edit their own data, you can ensure\nthat requests from a particular user are always routed to the same datacenter and use\nthe leader in that datacenter for reading and writing.

What if only one out of three replicas\naccepted the write?

In this case, reads and writes will still be sent to n nodes, but a\nsmaller number of successful responses is required for the operation to succeed.\nWith a smaller w and r you are more likely to read stale values, because it\u2019s more\nlikely that your read didn\u2019t include the node with the latest value.

Whether one operation happens before another\noperation is the key to defining what concurrency means. In fact, we can simply say\nthat two operations are concurrent  if neither happens before the other (i.e., neither\nknows about the other) [ 54].\nThus, whenever you have two operations A and B, there are three possibilities: either\nA happened before B, or B happened before A, or A and B are concurrent.

People sometimes make a connection between this principle\nand the special theory of relativity in physics [ 54], which introduced the idea that\ninformation cannot travel faster than the speed of light. Consequently, two events\nthat occur some distance apart cannot possibly affect each other if the time between\nthe events is shorter than the time it takes light to travel the distance between them.\nIn computer systems, two operations might be concurrent even though the speed of\nlight would in principle have allowed one operation to affect the other.

It requires carefully thinking\nabout concurrency and about all the things that can go wrong, and dealing with the\nconsequences of those faults. At a minimum, we need to deal with unavailable nodes\nand network interruptions (and that\u2019s not even considering the more insidious kinds\nof fault, such as silent data corruption due to software bugs).\nWe discussed three main approaches to replication:\nSingle-leader replication\nClients send all writes to a single node (the leader), which sends a stream of data\nchange events to the other replicas (followers). Reads can be performed on any\nreplica, but reads from followers might be stale.\nMulti-leader replication\nClients send each write to one of several leader nodes, any of which can accept\nwrites. The leaders send streams of data change events to each other and to any\nfollower nodes.\nLeaderless replication\nClients send each write to several nodes, and read from several nodes in parallel\nin order to detect and correct nodes with stale data.\nEach approach has advantages and disadvantages. Single-leader replication is popular\nbecause it is fairly easy to understand and there is no conflict resolution to worry\nabout.

If you also know which partition is\nassigned to which node, then you can make your request directly to the appropriate\nnode (or, in the case of the encyclopedia, pick the correct book off the shelf).\nFigure 6-2. A print encyclopedia is partitioned by key range.\nThe ranges of keys are not necessarily evenly spaced, because your data may not be\nevenly distributed. For example, in Figure 6-2 , volume 1 contains words starting with\nA and B, but volume 12 contains words starting with T, U, V, X, Y, and Z. Simply\nhaving one volume per two letters of the alphabet would lead to some volumes being\nmuch bigger than others.

For example, you could prefix each\ntimestamp with the sensor name so that the partitioning is first by sensor name and\nthen by time. Assuming you have many sensors active at the same time, the write\nload will end up more evenly spread across the partitions. Now, when you want to\nfetch the values of multiple sensors within a time range, you need to perform a sepa\u2010\nrate range query for each sensor name.\nPartitioning by Hash of Key\nBecause of this risk of skew and hot spots, many distributed datastores use a hash\nfunction to determine the partition for a given key.\nA good hash function takes skewed data and makes it uniformly distributed.

Even if the input strings\nare very similar, their hashes are evenly distributed across that range of numbers.\nFor partitioning purposes, the hash function need not be cryptographically strong:\nfor example, Cassandra and MongoDB use MD5, and Voldemort uses the Fowler\u2013\nNoll\u2013Vo function. Many programming languages have simple hash functions built in\n(as they are used for hash tables), but they may not be suitable for partitioning: for\nexample, in Java\u2019s Object.hashCode()  and Ruby\u2019s Object#hash , the same key may\nhave a different hash value in different processes [ 6].\nOnce you have a suitable hash function for keys, you can assign each partition a\nrange of hashes (rather than a range of keys), and every key whose hash falls within a\npartition\u2019s range will be stored in that partition.

Just a two-digit decimal random number\nwould split the writes to the key evenly across 100 different keys, allowing those keys\nto be distributed to different partitions.\nHowever, having split the writes across different keys, any reads now have to do addi\u2010\ntional work, as they have to read the data from all 100 keys and combine it.

Let\u2019s briefly dis\u2010\ncuss each in turn.\nHow not to do it: hash mod N\nWhen partitioning by the hash of a key, we said earlier ( Figure 6-3 ) that it\u2019s best to\ndivide the possible hashes into ranges and assign each range to a partition (e.g., assign\nkey to partition 0 if 0 \u2264 hash (key) < b0, to partition 1 if b0 \u2264 hash (key) < b1, etc.).\nPerhaps you wondered why we don\u2019t just use mod  (the % operator in many program\u2010\nming languages). For example, hash (key) mod  10 would return a number between 0\nand 9 (if we write the hash as a decimal number, the hash mod  10 would be the last\ndigit). If we have 10 nodes, numbered 0 to 9, that seems like an easy way of assigning\neach key to a node.\nThe problem with the mod N  approach is that if the number of nodes N changes,\nmost of the keys will need to be moved from one node to another. For example, say\nhash (key) = 123456. If you initially have 10 nodes, that key starts out on node 6\n(because 123456 mod  10 = 6). When you grow to 11 nodes, the key needs to move to\nnode 3 (123456 mod  11 = 3), and when you grow to 12 nodes, it needs to move to\nnode 0 (123456 mod  12 = 0). Such frequent moves make rebalancing excessively\nexpensive.\nWe need an approach that doesn\u2019t move data around more than necessary.\nFixed number of partitions\nFortunately, there is a fairly simple solution: create many more partitions than there\nare nodes, and assign several partitions to each node. For example, a database run\u2010\nning on a cluster of 10 nodes may be split into 1,000 partitions from the outset so that\napproximately 100 partitions are assigned to each node.\nNow, if a node is added to the cluster, the new node can steal  a few partitions from\nevery existing node until partitions are fairly distributed once again. This process is\nillustrated in Figure 6-6 . If a node is removed from the cluster, the same happens in\nreverse.\nOnly entire partitions are moved between nodes. The number of partitions does not\nchange, nor does the assignment of keys to partitions. The only thing that changes is\nthe assignment of partitions to nodes.

Reconfiguring the partition bound\u2010\naries manually would be very tedious.\nFor that reason, key range\u2013partitioned databases such as HBase and RethinkDB cre\u2010\nate partitions dynamically. When a partition grows to exceed a configured size (on\nHBase, the default is 10 GB), it is split into two partitions so that approximately half\nof the data ends up on each side of the split [ 26]. Conversely, if lots of data is deleted\nand a partition shrinks below some threshold, it can be merged with an adjacent par\u2010\ntition. This process is similar to what happens at the top level of a B-tree (see \u201cB-\nTrees\u201d on page 79 ).\nEach partition is assigned to one node, and each node can handle multiple partitions,\nlike in the case of a fixed number of partitions. After a large partition has been split,\none of its two halves can be transferred to another node in order to balance the load.\nIn the case of HBase, the transfer of partition files happens through HDFS, the\nunderlying distributed filesystem [ 3].\nAn advantage of dynamic partitioning is that the number of partitions adapts to the\ntotal data volume. If there is only a small amount of data, a small number of parti\u2010\ntions is sufficient, so overheads are small; if there is a huge amount of data, the size of\neach individual partition is limited to a configurable maximum [ 23].\nHowever, a caveat is that an empty database starts off with a single partition, since\nthere is no a priori  information about where to draw the partition boundaries. While\nthe dataset is small\u2014until it hits the point at which the first partition is split\u2014all\nwrites have to be processed by a single node while the other nodes sit idle. To miti\u2010\ngate this issue, HBase and MongoDB allow an initial set of partitions to be configured\non an empty database (this is called pre-splitting ). In the case of key-range partition\u2010\ning, pre-splitting requires that you already know what the key distribution is going to\nlook like [ 4, 26].\nDynamic partitioning is not only suitable for key range\u2013partitioned data, but can\nequally well be used with hash-partitioned data. MongoDB since version 2.4 supports\nboth key-range and hash partitioning, and it splits partitions dynamically in either\ncase.\nPartitioning proportionally to nodes\nWith dynamic partitioning, the number of partitions is proportional to the size of the\ndataset, since the splitting and merging processes keep the size of each partition\nbetween some fixed minimum and maximum.

In\nboth of these cases, the number of partitions is independent of the number of nodes.\nA third option, used by Cassandra and Ketama, is to make the number of partitions\nproportional to the number of nodes\u2014in other words, to have a fixed number of par\u2010\ntitions per node  [23, 27, 28]. In this case, the size of each partition grows proportion\u2010\nally to the dataset size while the number of nodes remains unchanged, but when you\nincrease the number of nodes, the partitions become smaller again. Since a larger\ndata volume generally requires a larger number of nodes to store, this approach also\nkeeps the size of each partition fairly stable.\nWhen a new node joins the cluster, it randomly chooses a fixed number of existing\npartitions to split, and then takes ownership of one half of each of those split parti\u2010\ntions while leaving the other half of each partition in place. The randomization can\nproduce unfair splits, but when averaged over a larger number of partitions (in Cas\u2010\nsandra, 256 partitions per node by default), the new node ends up taking a fair share\nof the load from the existing nodes. Cassandra 3.0 introduced an alternative rebalanc\u2010\ning algorithm that avoids unfair splits [ 29].\nPicking partition boundaries randomly requires that hash-based partitioning is used\n(so the boundaries can be picked from the range of numbers produced by the hash\nfunction). Indeed, this approach corresponds most closely to the original definition\nof consistent hashing [ 7] (see \u201cConsistent Hashing\u201d on page 204). Newer hash func\u2010\ntions can achieve a similar effect with lower metadata overhead [ 8].\nOperations: Automatic or Manual Rebalancing\nThere is one important question with regard to rebalancing that we have glossed\nover: does the rebalancing happen automatically or manually?\nThere is a gradient between fully automatic rebalancing (the system decides automat\u2010\nically when to move partitions from one node to another, without any administrator\ninteraction) and fully manual (the assignment of partitions to nodes is explicitly con\u2010\nfigured by an administrator, and only changes when the administrator explicitly\nreconfigures it). For example, Couchbase, Riak, and Voldemort generate a suggested\npartition assignment automatically, but require an administrator to commit it before\nit takes effect.\nFully automated rebalancing can be convenient, because there is less operational\nwork to do for normal maintenance. However, it can be unpredictable. Rebalancing\nis an expensive operation, because it requires rerouting requests and moving a large\namount of data from one node to another. If it is not done carefully, this process can\noverload the network or the nodes and harm the performance of other requests while\nthe rebalancing is in progress.\nRebalancing Partitions | 213",

In this case, a client can connect directly to the appropriate node,\nwithout any intermediary.\nIn all cases, the key problem is: how does the component making the routing decision\n(which may be one of the nodes, or the routing tier, or the client) learn about changes\nin the assignment of partitions to nodes?\n214 | Chapter 6: Partitioning",

A transaction is a way for an application to group several reads and writes\ntogether into a logical unit. Conceptually, all the reads and writes in a transaction are\nexecuted as one operation: either the entire transaction succeeds ( commit ) or it fails\n(abort , rollback ). If it fails, the application can safely retry. With transactions, error\nhandling becomes much simpler for an application, because it doesn\u2019t need to worry\nabout partial failure\u2014i.e., the case where some operations succeed and some fail (for\nwhatever reason).\nIf you have spent years working with transactions, they may seem obvious, but we\nshouldn\u2019t take them for granted. Transactions are not a law of nature; they were cre\u2010\nated with a purpose, namely to simplify the programming model  for applications\naccessing a database. By using transactions, the application is free to ignore certain\npotential error scenarios and concurrency issues, because the database takes care of\nthem instead (we call these safety guarantees ).\nNot every application needs transactions, and sometimes there are advantages to\nweakening transactional guarantees or abandoning them entirely (for example, to\nachieve higher performance or higher availability). Some safety properties can be\nachieved without transactions.\nHow do you figure out whether you need transactions? In order to answer that ques\u2010\ntion, we first need to understand exactly what safety guarantees transactions can pro\u2010\nvide, and what costs are associated with them. Although transactions seem\nstraightforward at first glance, there are actually many subtle but important details\nthat come into play.\nIn this chapter, we will examine many examples of things that can go wrong, and\nexplore the algorithms that databases use to guard against those issues. We will go\nespecially deep in the area of concurrency control, discussing various kinds of race\nconditions that can occur and how databases implement isolation levels such as read\ncommitted , snapshot isolation , and serializability .\nThis chapter applies to both single-node and distributed databases; in Chapter 8  we\nwill focus the discussion on the particular challenges that arise only in distributed\nsystems.\nThe Slippery Concept of a Transaction\nAlmost all relational databases today, and some nonrelational databases, support\ntransactions. Most of them follow the style that was introduced in 1975 by IBM Sys\u2010\ntem R, the first SQL database [ 1, 2, 3]. Although some implementation details have\nchanged, the general idea has remained virtually the same for 40 years: the transac\u2010\ntion support in MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc., is uncannily similar to\nthat of System R.\n222 | Chapter 7: Transactions",

They\naimed to improve upon the relational status quo by offering a choice of new data\nmodels (see Chapter 2 ), and by including replication ( Chapter 5 ) and partitioning\n(Chapter 6 ) by default. Transactions were the main casualty of this movement: many\nof this new generation of databases abandoned transactions entirely, or redefined the\nword to describe a much weaker set of guarantees than had previously been under\u2010\nstood [ 4].\nWith the hype around this new crop of distributed databases, there emerged a popu\u2010\nlar belief that transactions were the antithesis of scalability, and that any large-scale\nsystem would have to abandon transactions in order to maintain good performance\nand high availability [ 5, 6].

It was coined in 1983 by Theo H\u00e4rder and Andreas Reuter [ 7] in an effort to\nestablish precise terminology for fault-tolerance mechanisms in databases.\nHowever, in practice, one database\u2019s implementation of ACID does not equal\nanother\u2019s implementation. For example, as we shall see, there is a lot of ambiguity\naround the meaning of isolation  [8]. The high-level idea is sound, but the devil is in\nthe details. Today, when a system claims to be \u201cACID compliant,\u201d it\u2019s unclear what\nguarantees you can actually expect. ACID has unfortunately become mostly a mar\u2010\nketing term.\n(Systems that do not meet the ACID criteria are sometimes called BASE , which\nstands for Basically Available , Soft state , and Eventual consistency  [9]. This is even\nmore vague than the definition of ACID. It seems that the only sensible definition of\nBASE is \u201cnot ACID\u201d; i.e., it can mean almost anything you want.)\nLet\u2019s dig into the definitions of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability, as\nthis will let us refine our idea of transactions.\nAtomicity\nIn general, atomic  refers to something that cannot be broken down into smaller parts.\nThe word means similar but subtly different things in different branches of comput\u2010\nThe Slippery Concept of a Transaction | 223",

For example, in multi-threaded programming, if one thread executes an atomic\noperation, that means there is no way that another thread could see the half-finished\nresult of the operation. The system can only be in the state it was before the operation\nor after the operation, not something in between.\nBy contrast, in the context of ACID, atomicity is not about concurrency. It does not\ndescribe what happens if several processes try to access the same data at the same\ntime, because that is covered under the letter I, for isolation  (see \u201cIsolation\u201d  on page\n225).\nRather, ACID atomicity describes what happens if a client wants to make several\nwrites, but a fault occurs after some of the writes have been processed\u2014for example,\na process crashes, a network connection is interrupted, a disk becomes full, or some\nintegrity constraint is violated. If the writes are grouped together into an atomic\ntransaction, and the transaction cannot be completed ( committed ) due to a fault, then\nthe transaction is aborted  and the database must discard or undo any writes it has\nmade so far in that transaction.\nWithout atomicity, if an error occurs partway through making multiple changes, it\u2019s\ndifficult to know which changes have taken effect and which haven\u2019t. The application\ncould try again, but that risks making the same change twice, leading to duplicate or\nincorrect data. Atomicity simplifies this problem: if a transaction was aborted, the\napplication can be sure that it didn\u2019t change anything, so it can safely be retried.\nThe ability to abort a transaction on error and have all writes from that transaction\ndiscarded is the defining feature of ACID atomicity.

Joe Hellerstein has remarked that the C in ACID was \u201ctossed in to make the acronym work\u201d in H\u00e4rder and\nReuter\u2019s paper [ 7], and that it wasn\u2019t considered important at the time.The idea of ACID consistency is that you have certain statements about your data\n(invariants ) that must always be true\u2014for example, in an accounting system, credits\nand debits across all accounts must always be balanced. If a transaction starts with a\ndatabase that is valid according to these invariants, and any writes during the transac\u2010\ntion preserve the validity, then you can be sure that the invariants are always satisfied.\nHowever, this idea of consistency depends on the application\u2019s notion of invariants,\nand it\u2019s the application\u2019s responsibility to define its transactions correctly so that they\npreserve consistency. This is not something that the database can guarantee: if you\nwrite bad data that violates your invariants, the database can\u2019t stop you. (Some spe\u2010\ncific kinds of invariants can be checked by the database, for example using foreign\nkey constraints or uniqueness constraints. However, in general, the application\ndefines what data is valid or invalid\u2014the database only stores it.)\nAtomicity, isolation, and durability are properties of the database, whereas consis\u2010\ntency (in the ACID sense) is a property of the application. The application may rely\non the database\u2019s atomicity and isolation properties in order to achieve consistency,\nbut it\u2019s not up to the database alone. Thus, the letter C doesn\u2019t really belong in ACID.i\nIsolation\nMost databases are accessed by several clients at the same time. That is no problem if\nthey are reading and writing different parts of the database, but if they are accessing\nthe same database records, you can run into concurrency problems (race conditions).\nFigure 7-1  is a simple example of this kind of problem. Say you have two clients\nsimultaneously incrementing a counter that is stored in a database. Each client needs\nto read the current value, add 1, and write the new value back (assuming there is no\nincrement operation built into the database). In Figure 7-1  the counter should have\nincreased from 42 to 44, because two increments happened, but it actually only went\nto 43 because of the race condition.\nIsolation  in the sense of ACID means that concurrently executing transactions are\nisolated from each other: they cannot step on each other\u2019s toes. The classic database\ntextbooks formalize isolation as serializability , which means that each transaction can\npretend that it is the only transaction running on the entire database. The database\nensures that when the transactions have committed, the result is the same as if they\nhad run serially  (one after another), even though in reality they may have run con\u2010\ncurrently [ 10].\nThe Slippery Concept of a Transaction | 225",

Seeing the database in a partially updated state is con\u2010\nfusing to users and may cause other transactions to take incorrect decisions.\n\u2022If a transaction aborts, any writes it has made need to be rolled back (like in\nFigure 7-3 ). If the database allows dirty reads, that means a transaction may see\ndata that is later rolled back\u2014i.e., which is never actually committed to the data\u2010\nbase. Reasoning about the consequences quickly becomes mind-bending.\nNo dirty writes\nWhat happens if two transactions concurrently try to update the same object in a\ndatabase? We don\u2019t know in which order the writes will happen, but we normally\nassume that the later write overwrites the earlier write.\nHowever, what happens if the earlier write is part of a transaction that has not yet\ncommitted, so the later write overwrites an uncommitted value? This is called a dirty\nwrite  [28]. Transactions running at the read committed isolation level must prevent\ndirty writes, usually by delaying the second write until the first write\u2019s transaction has\ncommitted or aborted.\nBy preventing dirty writes, this isolation level avoids some kinds of concurrency\nproblems:\n\u2022If transactions update multiple objects, dirty writes can lead to a bad outcome.\nFor example, consider Figure 7-5 , which illustrates a used car sales website on\nwhich two people, Alice and Bob, are simultaneously trying to buy the same car.\nBuying a car requires two database writes: the listing on the website needs to be\nupdated to reflect the buyer, and the sales invoice needs to be sent to the buyer.\nIn the case of Figure 7-5 , the sale is awarded to Bob (because he performs the\nwinning update to the listings  table), but the invoice is sent to Alice (because\nshe performs the winning update to the invoices  table).

However, reads do not require any locks.\nFrom a performance point of view, a key principle of snapshot isolation is readers\nnever block writers, and writers never block readers . This allows a database to handle\nlong-running read queries on a consistent snapshot at the same time as processing\nwrites normally, without any lock contention between the two.\nTo implement snapshot isolation, databases use a generalization of the mechanism\nwe saw for preventing dirty reads in Figure 7-4 . The database must potentially keep\nseveral different committed versions of an object, because various in-progress trans\u2010\nactions may need to see the state of the database at different points in time. Because it\nmaintains several versions of an object side by side, this technique is known as multi-\nversion concurrency control  (MVCC).\nIf a database only needed to provide read committed isolation, but not snapshot iso\u2010\nlation, it would be sufficient to keep two versions of an object: the committed version\nand the overwritten-but-not-yet-committed version. However, storage engines that\nsupport snapshot isolation typically use MVCC for their read committed isolation\nlevel as well. A typical approach is that read committed uses a separate snapshot for\neach query, while snapshot isolation uses the same snapshot for an entire transaction.\nFigure 7-7  illustrates how MVCC-based snapshot isolation is implemented in Post\u2010\ngreSQL [ 31] (other implementations are similar).

    "chunk": "Conflict resolution and replication\nIn replicated databases (see Chapter 5 ), preventing lost updates takes on another\ndimension: since they have copies of the data on multiple nodes, and the data can\npotentially be modified concurrently on different nodes, some additional steps need\nto be taken to prevent lost updates.\nLocks and compare-and-set operations assume that there is a single up-to-date copy\nof the data. However, databases with multi-leader or leaderless replication usually\nallow several writes to happen concurrently and replicate them asynchronously, so\nthey cannot guarantee that there is a single up-to-date copy of the data. Thus, techni\u2010\nques based on locks or compare-and-set do not apply in this context. (We will revisit\nthis issue in more detail in \u201cLinearizability\u201d on page 324 .)\nInstead, as discussed in \u201cDetecting Concurrent Writes\u201d on page 184, a common\napproach in such replicated databases is to allow concurrent writes to create several\nconflicting versions of a value (also known as siblings ), and to use application code or\nspecial data structures to resolve and merge these versions after the fact.\nAtomic operations can work well in a replicated context, especially if they are com\u2010\nmutative (i.e., you can apply them in a different order on different replicas, and still\nget the same result). For example, incrementing a counter or adding an element to a\nset are commutative operations. That is the idea behind Riak 2.0 datatypes, which\nprevent lost updates across replicas. When a value is concurrently updated by differ\u2010\nent clients, Riak automatically merges together the updates in such a way that no\nupdates are lost [ 39].\nOn the other hand, the last write wins  (LWW) conflict resolution method is prone to\nlost updates, as discussed in \u201cLast write wins (discarding concurrent writes)\u201d  on page\n186. Unfortunately, LWW is the default in many replicated databases. \nWrite Skew and Phantoms\nIn the previous sections we saw dirty writes  and lost updates , two kinds of race condi\u2010\ntions that can occur when different transactions concurrently try to write to the same\nobjects. In order to avoid data corruption, those race conditions need to be prevented\n\u2014either automatically by the database, or by manual safeguards such as using locks\nor atomic write operations.\nHowever, that is not the end of the list of potential race conditions that can occur\nbetween concurrent writes. In this section we will see some subtler examples of\nconflicts.\nTo begin, imagine this example: you are writing an application for doctors to manage\ntheir on-call shifts at a hospital.

When all data that a transaction needs to access is in memory, transactions\ncan execute much faster than if they have to wait for data to be loaded from disk.\n\u2022Database designers realized that OLTP transactions are usually short and only\nmake a small number of reads and writes (see \u201cTransaction Processing or Ana\u2010\nlytics?\u201d on page 90 ). By contrast, long-running analytic queries are typically read-\nonly, so they can be run on a consistent snapshot (using snapshot isolation)\noutside of the serial execution loop.\nThe approach of executing transactions serially is implemented in VoltDB/H-Store,\nRedis, and Datomic [ 46, 47, 48]. A system designed for single-threaded execution can\nsometimes perform better than a system that supports concurrency, because it can\navoid the coordination overhead of locking.

In order to make the most of that single thread, transac\u2010\ntions need to be structured differently from their traditional form.\nEncapsulating transactions in stored procedures\nIn the early days of databases, the intention was that a database transaction could\nencompass an entire flow of user activity. For example, booking an airline ticket is a\nmulti-stage process (searching for routes, fares, and available seats; deciding on an\nitinerary; booking seats on each of the flights of the itinerary; entering passenger\ndetails; making payment). Database designers thought that it would be neat if that\nentire process was one transaction so that it could be committed atomically.\nUnfortunately, humans are very slow to make up their minds and respond. If a data\u2010\nbase transaction needs to wait for input from a user, the database needs to support a\npotentially huge number of concurrent transactions, most of them idle. Most data\u2010\nbases cannot do that efficiently, and so almost all OLTP applications keep transac\u2010\ntions short by avoiding interactively waiting for a user within a transaction. On the\nweb, this means that a transaction is committed within the same HTTP request\u2014a\ntransaction does not span multiple requests.

These languages\nhaven\u2019t kept up with developments in general-purpose programming languages,\nso they look quite ugly and archaic from today\u2019s point of view, and they lack the\necosystem of libraries that you find with most programming languages.\n\u2022Code running in a database is difficult to manage: compared to an application\nserver, it\u2019s harder to debug, more awkward to keep in version control and deploy,\ntrickier to test, and difficult to integrate with a metrics collection system for\nmonitoring.\n\u2022A database is often much more performance-sensitive than an application server,\nbecause a single database instance is often shared by many application servers. A\nbadly written stored procedure (e.g., using a lot of memory or CPU time) in a\ndatabase can cause much more trouble than equivalent badly written code in an\napplication server.\nHowever, those issues can be overcome. Modern implementations of stored proce\u2010\ndures have abandoned PL/SQL and use existing general-purpose programming lan\u2010\nguages instead: VoltDB uses Java or Groovy, Datomic uses Java or Clojure, and Redis\nuses Lua.\nWith stored procedures and in-memory data, executing all transactions on a single\nthread becomes feasible. As they don\u2019t need to wait for I/O and they avoid the over\u2010\nhead of other concurrency control mechanisms, they can achieve quite good\nthroughput on a single thread.\nVoltDB also uses stored procedures for replication: instead of copying a transaction\u2019s\nwrites from one node to another, it executes the same stored procedure on each rep\u2010\nlica. VoltDB therefore requires that stored procedures are deterministic  (when run on\ndifferent nodes, they must produce the same result). If a transaction needs to use the\ncurrent date and time, for example, it must do so through special deterministic APIs. \nPartitioning\nExecuting all transactions serially makes concurrency control much simpler, but lim\u2010\nits the transaction throughput of the database to the speed of a single CPU core on a\nsingle machine.

If two-phase\nlocking includes predicate locks, the database prevents all forms of write skew and\nother race conditions, and so its isolation becomes serializable.\nIndex-range locks\nUnfortunately, predicate locks do not perform well: if there are many locks by active\ntransactions, checking for matching locks becomes time-consuming. For that reason,\nmost databases with 2PL actually implement index-range locking  (also known as next-\nkey locking ), which is a simplified approximation of predicate locking [ 41, 50].\nIt\u2019s safe to simplify a predicate by making it match a greater set of objects. For exam\u2010\nple, if you have a predicate lock for bookings of room 123 between noon and 1 p.m.,\nyou can approximate it by locking bookings for room 123 at any time, or you can\napproximate it by locking all rooms (not just room 123) between noon and 1 p.m.\nThis is safe, because any write that matches the original predicate will definitely also\nmatch the approximations.\nIn the room bookings database you would probably have an index on the room_id\ncolumn, and/or indexes on start_time  and end_time  (otherwise the preceding query\nwould be very slow on a large database):\n\u2022Say your index is on room_id , and the database uses this index to find existing\nbookings for room 123. Now the database can simply attach a shared lock to this\nindex entry, indicating that a transaction has searched for bookings of room 123.\n\u2022Alternatively, if the database uses a time-based index to find existing bookings, it\ncan attach a shared lock to a range of values in that index, indicating that a trans\u2010\naction has searched for bookings that overlap with the time period of noon to 1\np.m. on January 1, 2018.\nEither way, an approximation of the search condition is attached to one of the\nindexes. Now, if another transaction wants to insert, update, or delete a booking for\nthe same room and/or an overlapping time period, it will have to update the same\npart of the index. In the process of doing so, it will encounter the shared lock, and it\nwill be forced to wait until the lock is released.\nThis provides effective protection against phantoms and write skew.

It is like mutual exclusion , which is used to protect data struc\u2010\ntures in multi-threaded programming.\nSerial execution is, in a sense, pessimistic to the extreme: it is essentially equivalent to\neach transaction having an exclusive lock on the entire database (or one partition of\nthe database) for the duration of the transaction.

The core problem is that if a transaction reads a state and then makes a decision based on that read, that state might change before the transaction commits.

High contention exacerbates this, leading to more transaction aborts.

The core issue is that when a transaction reads data, another transaction might modify it concurrently. SSI\u2019s approach is to delay aborting a transaction until the commit phase, recognizing that the read might have become stale. This isn\u2019t just about consistency; it\u2019s a fundamental trade-off between strong consistency and performance.  Delaying the abort allows for potentially long-running reads that benefit from a consistent snapshot, but introduces the risk of needing to rollback. It\u2019s essential to understand how this impacts the overall system architecture and potential recovery strategies.\u201d",

    "chunk": "In Figure 7-11 , transactions 42 and 43 both search for on-call doctors during shift\n1234 . If there is an index on shift_id , the database can use the index entry 1234 to\nrecord the fact that transactions 42 and 43 read this data. (If there is no index, this\ninformation can be tracked at the table level.) This information only needs to be kept\nfor a while: after a transaction has finished (committed or aborted), and all concur\u2010\nrent transactions have finished, the database can forget what data it read.\nWhen a transaction writes to the database, it must look in the indexes for any other\ntransactions that have recently read the affected data. This process is similar to\nacquiring a write lock on the affected key range, but rather than blocking until the\nreaders have committed, the lock acts as a tripwire: it simply notifies the transactions\nthat the data they read may no longer be up to date.\nIn Figure 7-11 , transaction 43 notifies transaction 42 that its prior read is outdated,\nand vice versa. Transaction 42 is first to commit, and it is successful: although trans\u2010\naction 43\u2019s write affected 42, 43 hasn\u2019t yet committed, so the write has not yet taken\neffect. However, when transaction 43 wants to commit, the conflicting write from 42\nhas already been committed, so 43 must abort. \nPerformance of serializable snapshot isolation\nAs always, many engineering details affect how well an algorithm works in practice.\nFor example, one trade-off is the granularity at which transactions\u2019 reads and writes\nare tracked. If the database keeps track of each transaction\u2019s activity in great detail, it\ncan be precise about which transactions need to abort, but the bookkeeping overhead\ncan become significant. Less detailed tracking is faster, but may lead to more transac\u2010\ntions being aborted than strictly necessary.\nIn some cases, it\u2019s okay for a transaction to read information that was overwritten by\nanother transaction: depending on what else happened, it\u2019s sometimes possible to\nprove that the result of the execution is nevertheless serializable. PostgreSQL uses this\ntheory to reduce the number of unnecessary aborts [ 11, 41].\nCompared to two-phase locking, the big advantage of serializable snapshot isolation\nis that one transaction doesn\u2019t need to block waiting for locks held by another trans\u2010\naction. Like under snapshot isolation, writers don\u2019t block readers, and vice versa. This\ndesign principle makes query latency much more predictable and less variable. In\nparticular, read-only queries can run on a consistent snapshot without requiring any\nlocks, which is very appealing for read-heavy workloads.\nCompared to serial execution, serializable snapshot isolation is not limited to the\nthroughput of a single CPU core: FoundationDB distributes the detection of seriali\u2010\nzation conflicts across multiple machines, allowing it to scale to very high through\u2010\nput. Even though data may be partitioned across multiple machines, transactions can\nread and write data in multiple partitions while ensuring serializable isolation [ 54].\nSerializability | 265",

    "chunk": "The rate of aborts significantly affects the overall performance of SSI. For example, a\ntransaction that reads and writes data over a long period of time is likely to run into\nconflicts and abort, so SSI requires that read-write transactions be fairly short (long-\nrunning read-only transactions may be okay). However, SSI is probably less sensitive\nto slow transactions than two-phase locking or serial execution. \nSummary\nTransactions are an abstraction layer that allows an application to pretend that cer\u2010\ntain concurrency problems and certain kinds of hardware and software faults don\u2019t\nexist. A large class of errors is reduced down to a simple transaction abort , and the\napplication just needs to try again.\nIn this chapter we saw many examples of problems that transactions help prevent.\nNot all applications are susceptible to all those problems: an application with very\nsimple access patterns, such as reading and writing only a single record, can probably\nmanage without transactions. However, for more complex access patterns, transac\u2010\ntions can hugely reduce the number of potential error cases you need to think about.\nWithout transactions, various error scenarios (processes crashing, network interrup\u2010\ntions, power outages, disk full, unexpected concurrency, etc.) mean that data can\nbecome inconsistent in various ways. For example, denormalized data can easily go\nout of sync with the source data. Without transactions, it becomes very difficult to\nreason about the effects that complex interacting accesses can have on the database.\nIn this chapter, we went particularly deep into the topic of concurrency control. We\ndiscussed several widely used isolation levels, in particular read committed , snapshot\nisolation  (sometimes called repeatable read ), and serializable . We characterized those\nisolation levels by discussing various examples of race conditions:\nDirty reads\nOne client reads another client\u2019s writes before they have been committed. The\nread committed isolation level and stronger levels prevent dirty reads.\nDirty writes\nOne client overwrites data that another client has written, but not yet committed.\nAlmost all transaction implementations prevent dirty writes.\nRead skew (nonrepeatable reads)\nA client sees different parts of the database at different points in time. This issue\nis most commonly prevented with snapshot isolation, which allows a transaction\nto read from a consistent snapshot at one point in time. It is usually implemented\nwith multi-version concurrency control  (MVCC).\n266 | Chapter 7: Transactions",

But first, in this chapter, we must understand what challenges we\nare up against.\nThis chapter is a thoroughly pessimistic and depressing overview of things that may\ngo wrong in a distributed system.

Buggy software may give the appearance\nthat the computer is sometimes \u201chaving a bad day\u201d (a problem that is often fixed by a\nreboot), but that is mostly just a consequence of badly written software.\nThere is no fundamental reason why software on a single computer should be flaky:\nwhen the hardware is working correctly, the same operation always produces the\nsame result (it is deterministic ). If there is a hardware problem (e.g., memory corrup\u2010\ntion or a loose connector), the consequence is usually a total system failure (e.g., ker\u2010\nnel panic, \u201cblue screen of death,\u201d failure to start up). An individual computer with\ngood software is usually either fully functional or entirely broken, but not something\nin between.\nThis is a deliberate choice in the design of computers: if an internal fault occurs, we\nprefer a computer to crash completely rather than returning a wrong result, because\nwrong results are difficult and confusing to deal with. Thus, computers hide the fuzzy\nphysical reality on which they are implemented and present an idealized system\nmodel that operates with mathematical perfection. A CPU instruction always does\nthe same thing; if you write some data to memory or disk, that data remains intact\nand doesn\u2019t get randomly corrupted. This design goal of always-correct computation\ngoes all the way back to the very first digital computer [ 3].\nWhen you are writing software that runs on several computers, connected by a net\u2010\nwork, the situation is fundamentally different. In distributed systems, we are no\nlonger operating in an idealized system model\u2014we have no choice but to confront\nthe messy reality of the physical world.

And I\u2019m not even an ops guy.\n\u2014Coda Hale\nIn a distributed system, there may well be some parts of the system that are broken in\nsome unpredictable way, even though other parts of the system are working fine. This\nis known as a partial failure . The difficulty is that partial failures are nondeterministic :\nif you try to do anything involving multiple nodes and the network, it may sometimes\nwork and sometimes unpredictably fail. As we shall see, you may not even know\nwhether something succeeded or not, as the time it takes for a message to travel\nacross a network is also nondeterministic!\nThis nondeterminism and possibility of partial failures is what makes distributed sys\u2010\ntems hard to work with [ 5].\nCloud Computing and Supercomputing\nThere is a spectrum of philosophies on how to build large-scale computing systems:\n\u2022At one end of the scale is the field of high-performance computing  (HPC). Super\u2010\ncomputers with thousands of CPUs are typically used for computationally inten\u2010\nsive scientific computing tasks, such as weather forecasting or molecular\ndynamics (simulating the movement of atoms and molecules).\n\u2022At the other extreme is cloud computing , which is not very well defined [ 6] but is\noften associated with multi-tenant datacenters, commodity computers connected\nwith an IP network (often Ethernet), elastic/on-demand resource allocation, and\nmetered billing.\n\u2022Traditional enterprise datacenters lie somewhere between these extremes.\nWith these philosophies come very different approaches to handling faults. In a\nsupercomputer, a job typically checkpoints the state of its computation to durable\nstorage from time to time. If one node fails, a common solution is to simply stop the\nentire cluster workload. After the faulty node is repaired, the computation is restarted\nfrom the last checkpoint [ 7, 8]. Thus, a supercomputer is more like a single-node\ncomputer than a distributed system: it deals with partial failure by letting it escalate\ninto total failure\u2014if any part of the system fails, just let everything crash (like a kernel\npanic on a single machine).\nIn this book we focus on systems for implementing internet services, which usually\nlook very different from supercomputers:\nFaults and Partial Failures | 275",

The core takeaway here is that we're dealing with a fundamentally different kind of failure mode than what we typically see in monolithic applications. In a distributed environment, a partial failure \u2013 where only some nodes are impacted \u2013 is the norm, not the exception. This creates a significant challenge because our assumptions about data consistency and availability become unreliable. The HPC approach of simply letting the whole cluster crash after a failure highlights a critical trade-off: simplicity versus resilience.

In contrast, off\u2010\nline (batch) jobs like weather simulations can be stopped and restarted with fairly\nlow impact.\n\u2022Supercomputers are typically built from specialized hardware, where each node\nis quite reliable, and nodes communicate through shared memory and remote\ndirect memory access (RDMA). On the other hand, nodes in cloud services are\nbuilt from commodity machines, which can provide equivalent performance at\nlower cost due to economies of scale, but also have higher failure rates.\n\u2022Large datacenter networks are often based on IP and Ethernet, arranged in Clos\ntopologies to provide high bisection bandwidth [ 9]. Supercomputers often use\nspecialized network topologies, such as multi-dimensional meshes and toruses\n[10], which yield better performance for HPC workloads with known communi\u2010\ncation patterns.\n\u2022The bigger a system gets, the more likely it is that one of its components is bro\u2010\nken. Over time, broken things get fixed and new things break, but in a system\nwith thousands of nodes, it is reasonable to assume that something  is always bro\u2010\nken [ 7].

There is unfortunately no simple answer.\nA long timeout means a long wait until a node is declared dead (and during this time,\nusers may have to wait or see error messages). A short timeout detects faults faster,\nbut carries a higher risk of incorrectly declaring a node dead when in fact it has only\nsuffered a temporary slowdown (e.g., due to a load spike on the node or the network).\nPrematurely declaring a node dead is problematic: if the node is actually alive and in\nthe middle of performing some action (for example, sending an email), and another\nnode takes over, the action may end up being performed twice. We will discuss this\nissue in more detail in \u201cKnowledge, Truth, and Lies\u201d on page 300, and in Chapters 9\nand 11.\nWhen a node is declared dead, its responsibilities need to be transferred to other\nnodes, which places additional load on other nodes and the network. If the system is\nalready struggling with high load, declaring nodes dead prematurely can make the\nproblem worse. In particular, it could happen that the node actually wasn\u2019t dead but\nonly slow to respond due to overload; transferring its load to other nodes can cause a\ncascading failure (in the extreme case, all nodes declare each other dead, and every\u2010\nthing stops working).\nUnreliable Networks | 281",

Each circuit that is switched over this wire occupies one of those\ncall slots. Thus, you can think of the wire as a resource that can be shared by up to\n10,000 simultaneous users.

This approach has the downside of queueing, but the advan\u2010\ntage is that it maximizes utilization of the wire. The wire has a fixed cost, so if you\nutilize it better, each byte you send over the wire is cheaper.\nA similar situation arises with CPUs: if you share each CPU core dynamically\nbetween several threads, one thread sometimes has to wait in the operating system\u2019s\nrun queue while another thread is running, so a thread can be paused for varying\nlengths of time.

The resolution of monotonic clocks is usually quite\ngood: on most systems they can measure time intervals in microseconds or less.\nIn a distributed system, using a monotonic clock for measuring elapsed time (e.g.,\ntimeouts) is usually fine, because it doesn\u2019t assume any synchronization between dif\u2010\nferent nodes\u2019 clocks and is not sensitive to slight inaccuracies of measurement.\nClock Synchronization and Accuracy\nMonotonic clocks don\u2019t need synchronization, but time-of-day clocks need to be set\naccording to an NTP server or other external time source in order to be useful.\nUnfortunately, our methods for getting a clock to tell the correct time aren\u2019t nearly as\nreliable or accurate as you might hope\u2014hardware clocks and NTP can be fickle\nbeasts. To give just a few examples:\n\u2022The quartz clock in a computer is not very accurate: it drifts  (runs faster or\nslower than it should). Clock drift varies depending on the temperature of the\nmachine. Google assumes a clock drift of 200 ppm (parts per million) for its\nservers [ 41], which is equivalent to 6 ms drift for a clock that is resynchronized\nwith a server every 30 seconds, or 17 seconds drift for a clock that is resynchron\u2010\nized once a day. This drift limits the best possible accuracy you can achieve, even\nif everything is working correctly.\n\u2022If a computer\u2019s clock differs too much from an NTP server, it may refuse to syn\u2010\nchronize, or the local clock will be forcibly reset [ 37]. Any applications observing\nthe time before and after this reset may see time go backward or suddenly jump\nforward.\nUnreliable Clocks | 289",

Even though networks are well behaved most of the time, software must be\ndesigned on the assumption that the network will occasionally be faulty, and the soft\u2010\nware must handle such faults gracefully. The same is true with clocks: although they\nwork quite well most of the time, robust software needs to be prepared to deal with\nincorrect clocks.\nPart of the problem is that incorrect clocks easily go unnoticed. If a machine\u2019s CPU is\ndefective or its network is misconfigured, it most likely won\u2019t work at all, so it will\nquickly be noticed and fixed. On the other hand, if its quartz clock is defective or its\nNTP client is misconfigured, most things will seem to work fine, even though its\nclock gradually drifts further and further away from reality. If some piece of software\nis relying on an accurately synchronized clock, the result is more likely to be silent\nand subtle data loss than a dramatic crash [ 53, 54].\nThus, if you use software that requires synchronized clocks, it is essential that you\nalso carefully monitor the clock offsets between all the machines. Any node whose\nclock drifts too far from the others should be declared dead and removed from the\ncluster. Such monitoring ensures that you notice the broken clocks before they can\ncause too much damage.\nTimestamps for ordering events\nLet\u2019s consider one particular situation in which it is tempting, but dangerous, to rely\non clocks: ordering of events across multiple nodes. For example, if two clients write\nto a distributed database, who got there first? Which write is the more recent one?\nFigure 8-3  illustrates a dangerous use of time-of-day clocks in a database with multi-\nleader replication (the example is similar to Figure 5-9 ).

This\npause can occur at any time in a process\u2019s execution and can last for an arbitrary\nlength of time. This feature is sometimes used for live migration  of virtual\nmachines from one host to another without a reboot, in which case the length of\nthe pause depends on the rate at which processes are writing to memory [ 67].\n\u2022On end-user devices such as laptops, execution may also be suspended and\nresumed arbitrarily, e.g., when the user closes the lid of their laptop.\n\u2022When the operating system context-switches to another thread, or when the\nhypervisor switches to a different virtual machine (when running in a virtual\nmachine), the currently running thread can be paused at any arbitrary point in\nthe code.

In many languages, disk\naccess can happen surprisingly, even if the code doesn\u2019t explicitly mention file\naccess\u2014for example, the Java classloader lazily loads class files when they are first\nused, which could happen at any time in the program execution. I/O pauses and\nGC pauses may even conspire to combine their delays [ 69]. If the disk is actually\na network filesystem or network block device (such as Amazon\u2019s EBS), the I/O\nlatency is further subject to the variability of network delays [ 29].\n\u2022If the operating system is configured to allow swapping to disk  (paging ), a simple\nmemory access may result in a page fault that requires a page from disk to be\nloaded into memory. The thread is paused while this slow I/O operation takes\nplace. If memory pressure is high, this may in turn require a different page to be\nswapped out to disk. In extreme circumstances, the operating system may spend\nmost of its time swapping pages in and out of memory and getting little actual\nwork done (this is known as thrashing ). To avoid this problem, paging is often\ndisabled on server machines (if you would rather kill a process to free up mem\u2010\nory than risk thrashing).\n\u2022A Unix process can be paused by sending it the SIGSTOP  signal, for example by\npressing Ctrl-Z in a shell.

A node in the network cannot know  anything for sure\u2014it can\nonly make guesses based on the messages it receives (or doesn\u2019t receive) via the net\u2010\nwork. A node can only find out what state another node is in (what data it has stored,\nwhether it is correctly functioning, etc.) by exchanging messages with it. If a remote\nnode doesn\u2019t respond, there is no way of knowing what state it is in, because prob\u2010\nlems in the network cannot reliably be distinguished from problems at a node.\nDiscussions of these systems border on the philosophical: What do we know to be\ntrue or false in our system? How sure can we be of that knowledge, if the mechanisms\nfor perception and measurement are unreliable? Should software systems obey the\nlaws that we expect of the physical world, such as cause and effect?\nFortunately, we don\u2019t need to go as far as figuring out the meaning of life. In a dis\u2010\ntributed system, we can state the assumptions we are making about the behavior (the\nsystem model ) and design the actual system in such a way that it meets those assump\u2010\ntions. Algorithms can be proved to function correctly within a certain system model.\nThis means that reliable behavior is achievable, even if the underlying system model\nprovides very few guarantees.\nHowever, although it is possible to make software well behaved in an unreliable sys\u2010\ntem model, it is not straightforward to do so. In the rest of this chapter we will further\nexplore the notions of knowledge and truth in distributed systems, which will help us\nthink about the kinds of assumptions we can make and the guarantees we may want\nto provide.

For example:\n\u2022In aerospace environments, the data in a computer\u2019s memory or CPU register\ncould become corrupted by radiation, leading it to respond to other nodes in\narbitrarily unpredictable ways. Since a system failure would be very expensive\n(e.g., an aircraft crashing and killing everyone on board, or a rocket colliding\nwith the International Space Station), flight control systems must tolerate Byzan\u2010\ntine faults [ 81, 82].\n\u2022In a system with multiple participating organizations, some participants may\nattempt to cheat or defraud others. In such circumstances, it is not safe for a\nnode to simply trust another node\u2019s messages, since they may be sent with mali\u2010\ncious intent.

In your datacenter, all the nodes are con\u2010\ntrolled by your organization (so they can hopefully be trusted) and radiation levels\nare low enough that memory corruption is not a major problem. Protocols for mak\u2010\ning systems Byzantine fault-tolerant are quite complicated [ 84], and fault-tolerant\nembedded systems rely on support from the hardware level [ 81]. In most server-side\ndata systems, the cost of deploying Byzantine fault-tolerant solutions makes them\nimpractical.\nWeb applications do need to expect arbitrary and malicious behavior of clients that\nare under end-user control, such as web browsers. This is why input validation, sani\u2010\ntization, and output escaping are so important: to prevent SQL injection and cross-\nsite scripting, for example. However, we typically don\u2019t use Byzantine fault-tolerant\nprotocols here, but simply make the server the authority on deciding what client\nbehavior is and isn\u2019t allowed. In peer-to-peer networks, where there is no such cen\u2010\ntral authority, Byzantine fault tolerance is more relevant.\nA bug in the software could be regarded as a Byzantine fault, but if you deploy the\nsame software to all nodes, then a Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm cannot save you.\nMost Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms require a supermajority of more than two-\nthirds of the nodes to be functioning correctly (i.e., if you have four nodes, at most\none may malfunction). To use this approach against bugs, you would have to have\nfour independent implementations of the same software and hope that a bug only\nappears in one of the four implementations.\nKnowledge, Truth, and Lies | 305",

This does not imply exactly synchronized clocks or\nzero network delay; it just means you know that network delay, pauses, and clock\ndrift will never exceed some fixed upper bound [ 88]. The synchronous model is\nnot a realistic model of most practical systems, because (as discussed in this\nchapter) unbounded delays and pauses do occur.\nPartially synchronous model\nPartial synchrony means that a system behaves like a synchronous system most of\nthe time , but it sometimes exceeds the bounds for network delay, process pauses,\nand clock drift [ 88]. This is a realistic model of many systems: most of the time,\nnetworks and processes are quite well behaved\u2014otherwise we would never be\nable to get anything done\u2014but we have to reckon with the fact that any timing\nassumptions may be shattered occasionally. When this happens, network delay,\npauses, and clock error may become arbitrarily large.\nAsynchronous model\nIn this model, an algorithm is not allowed to make any timing assumptions\u2014in\nfact, it does not even have a clock (so it cannot use timeouts). Some algorithms\ncan be designed for the asynchronous model, but it is very restrictive.\nMoreover, besides timing issues, we have to consider node failures. The three most\ncommon system models for nodes are:\nCrash-stop faults\nIn the crash-stop model, an algorithm may assume that a node can fail in only\none way, namely by crashing. This means that the node may suddenly stop\nresponding at any moment, and thereafter that node is gone forever\u2014it never\ncomes back.\nCrash-recovery faults\nWe assume that nodes may crash at any moment, and perhaps start responding\nagain after some unknown time. In the crash-recovery model, nodes are assumed\nto have stable storage (i.e., nonvolatile disk storage) that is preserved across\ncrashes, while the in-memory state is assumed to be lost.\nByzantine (arbitrary) faults\nNodes may do absolutely anything, including trying to trick and deceive other\nnodes, as described in the last section.\nKnowledge, Truth, and Lies | 307",

We need to think about how we\u2019ll handle the inherent unpredictability. The crash-stop model is a good starting point\u2014allowing us to model failures where a node simply disappears.

That is simply a formal way of defining what it means for a\nlist to be sorted.\nSimilarly, we can write down the properties we want of a distributed algorithm to\ndefine what it means to be correct. For example, if we are generating fencing tokens\nfor a lock (see \u201cFencing tokens\u201d on page 303), we may require the algorithm to have\nthe following properties:\nUniqueness\nNo two requests for a fencing token return the same value.\nMonotonic sequence\nIf request x returned token tx, and request y returned token ty, and x completed\nbefore y began, then tx < ty.\nAvailability\nA node that requests a fencing token and does not crash eventually receives a\nresponse.\nAn algorithm is correct in some system model if it always satisfies its properties in all\nsituations that we assume may occur in that system model.

If all nodes crash, or all network delays suddenly become infinitely long, then\nno algorithm will be able to get anything done.\nSafety and liveness\nTo clarify the situation, it is worth distinguishing between two different kinds of\nproperties: safety  and liveness  properties. In the example just given, uniqueness  and\nmonotonic sequence  are safety properties, but availability  is a liveness property.\nWhat distinguishes the two kinds of properties? A giveaway is that liveness properties\noften include the word \u201ceventually\u201d in their definition.

The\nsimplest way of handling such faults is to simply let the entire service fail, and show\nthe user an error message. If that solution is unacceptable, we need to find ways of\ntolerating  faults\u2014that is, of keeping the service functioning correctly, even if some\ninternal component is faulty.\nIn this chapter, we will talk about some examples of algorithms and protocols for\nbuilding fault-tolerant distributed systems. We will assume that all the problems\nfrom Chapter 8  can occur: packets can be lost, reordered, duplicated, or arbitrarily\ndelayed in the network; clocks are approximate at best; and nodes can pause (e.g., due\nto garbage collection) or crash at any time.\nThe best way of building fault-tolerant systems is to find some general-purpose\nabstractions with useful guarantees, implement them once, and then let applications\nrely on those guarantees. This is the same approach as we used with transactions in\nChapter 7 : by using a transaction, the application can pretend that there are no\ncrashes (atomicity), that nobody else is concurrently accessing the database (isola\u2010\ntion), and that storage devices are perfectly reliable (durability). Even though crashes,\nrace conditions, and disk failures do occur, the transaction abstraction hides those\nproblems so that the application doesn\u2019t need to worry about them.\nWe will now continue along the same lines, and seek abstractions that can allow an\napplication to ignore some of the problems with distributed systems. For example,\none of the most important abstractions for distributed systems is consensus : that is,\ngetting all of the nodes to agree on something. As we shall see in this chapter, reliably\n321",

Viewing the final score of a sporting\nmatch is perhaps a frivolous example: a result that is outdated by a few seconds is\nunlikely to cause any real harm in this situation. However, there a few areas in which\nlinearizability is an important requirement for making a system work correctly.\nLocking and leader election\nA system that uses single-leader replication needs to ensure that there is indeed only\none leader, not several (split brain). One way of electing a leader is to use a lock: every\nnode that starts up tries to acquire the lock, and the one that succeeds becomes the\nleader [ 14]. No matter how this lock is implemented, it must be linearizable: all nodes\nmust agree which node owns the lock; otherwise it is useless.\nCoordination services like Apache ZooKeeper [ 15] and etcd [ 16] are often used to\nimplement distributed locks and leader election. They use consensus algorithms to\nimplement linearizable operations in a fault-tolerant way (we discuss such algorithms\nlater in this chapter, in \u201cFault-Tolerant Consensus\u201d on page 364).iii There are still\nmany subtle details to implementing locks and leader election correctly (see for\nexample the fencing issue in \u201cThe leader and the lock\u201d on page 301 ), and libraries like\nApache Curator [ 17] help by providing higher-level recipes on top of ZooKeeper.\nHowever, a linearizable storage service is the basic foundation for these coordination\ntasks.\nDistributed locking is also used at a much more granular level in some distributed\ndatabases, such as Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) [ 18]. RAC uses a lock per\ndisk page, with multiple nodes sharing access to the same disk storage system. Since\nthese linearizable locks are on the critical path of transaction execution, RAC deploy\u2010\nments usually have a dedicated cluster interconnect network for communication\nbetween database nodes.\nConstraints and uniqueness guarantees\nUniqueness constraints are common in databases: for example, a username or email\naddress must uniquely identify one user, and in a file storage service there cannot be\ntwo files with the same path and filename. If you want to enforce this constraint as\nthe data is written (such that if two people try to concurrently create a user or a file\nwith the same name, one of them will be returned an error), you need linearizability.\n330 | Chapter 9: Consistency and Consensus",

The architecture and dataflow of\nthis system is illustrated in Figure 9-5 .\nThe image resizer needs to be explicitly instructed to perform a resizing job, and this\ninstruction is sent from the web server to the resizer via a message queue (see Chap\u2010\nter 11 ).

CAP deserves credit for this\nculture shift\u2014witness the explosion of new database technologies since the\nmid-2000s (known as NoSQL).\nThe Unhelpful CAP Theorem\nCAP is sometimes presented as Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance: pick 2\nout of 3 .

When a network fault occurs, you have to\nchoose between either linearizability or total availability. Thus, a better way of phras\u2010\ning CAP would be either Consistent or Available when Partitioned  [39]. A more relia\u2010\nble network needs to make this choice less often, but at some point the choice is\ninevitable.\nIn discussions of CAP there are several contradictory definitions of the term availa\u2010\nbility , and the formalization as a theorem [ 30] does not match its usual meaning [ 40].\nMany so-called \u201chighly available\u201d (fault-tolerant) systems actually do not meet CAP\u2019s\nidiosyncratic definition of availability.

It makes no sense to use the CAP theorem to justify the\nmulti-core memory consistency model: within one computer we usually assume reli\u2010\nable communication, and we don\u2019t expect one CPU core to be able to continue oper\u2010\nating normally if it is disconnected from the rest of the computer. The reason for\ndropping linearizability is performance , not fault tolerance.\nThe same is true of many distributed databases that choose not to provide lineariza\u2010\nble guarantees: they do so primarily to increase performance, not so much for fault\ntolerance [ 46]. Linearizability is slow\u2014and this is true all the time, not only during a\nnetwork fault.\nCan\u2019t we maybe find a more efficient implementation of linearizable storage? It\nseems the answer is no: Attiya and Welch [ 47] prove that if you want linearizability,\nthe response time of read and write requests is at least proportional to the uncertainty\nof delays in the network. In a network with highly variable delays, like most com\u2010\nputer networks (see \u201cTimeouts and Unbounded Delays\u201d on page 281), the response\ntime of linearizable reads and writes is inevitably going to be high. A faster algorithm\nfor linearizability does not exist, but weaker consistency models can be much faster,\nso this trade-off is important for latency-sensitive systems.

Let\u2019s briefly recap some of the other contexts in which\nwe have discussed ordering:\n\u2022In Chapter 5  we saw that the main purpose of the leader in single-leader replica\u2010\ntion is to determine the order of writes  in the replication log\u2014that is, the order in\nwhich followers apply those writes. If there is no single leader, conflicts can occur\ndue to concurrent operations (see \u201cHandling Write Conflicts\u201d on page 171 ).\n\u2022Serializability, which we discussed in Chapter 7 , is about ensuring that transac\u2010\ntions behave as if they were executed in some sequential order . It can be achieved\nby literally executing transactions in that serial order, or by allowing concurrent\nexecution while preventing serialization conflicts (by locking or aborting).\n\u2022The use of timestamps and clocks in distributed systems that we discussed in\nChapter 8  (see \u201cRelying on Synchronized Clocks\u201d on page 291) is another\nattempt to introduce order into a disorderly world, for example to determine\nwhich one of two writes happened later.\nIt turns out that there are deep connections between ordering, linearizability, and\nconsensus. Although this notion is a bit more theoretical and abstract than the rest of\nthis book, it is very helpful for clarifying our understanding of what systems can and\ncannot do. We will explore this topic in the next few sections.\nOrdering and Causality\nThere are several reasons why ordering keeps coming up, and one of the reasons is\nthat it helps preserve causality . We have already seen several examples over the\ncourse of this book where causality has been important:\n\u2022In \u201cConsistent Prefix Reads\u201d on page 165 (Figure 5-5 ) we saw an example where\nthe observer of a conversation saw first the answer to a question, and then the\nquestion being answered.

Read skew (non-repeatable reads, as illustrated in\nFigure 7-6 ) means reading data in a state that violates causality.\n\u2022Our examples of write skew between transactions (see \u201cWrite Skew and Phan\u2010\ntoms\u201d  on page 246) also demonstrated causal dependencies: in Figure 7-8 , Alice\nwas allowed to go off call because the transaction thought that Bob was still on\ncall, and vice versa. In this case, the action of going off call is causally dependent\non the observation of who is currently on call. Serializable snapshot isolation (see\n\u201cSerializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI)\u201d on page 261) detects write skew by track\u2010\ning the causal dependencies between transactions.\n\u2022In the example of Alice and Bob watching football ( Figure 9-1 ), the fact that Bob\ngot a stale result from the server after hearing Alice exclaim the result is a causal\u2010\nity violation: Alice\u2019s exclamation is causally dependent on the announcement of\nthe score, so Bob should also be able to see the score after hearing Alice. The\nsame pattern appeared again in \u201cCross-channel timing dependencies\u201d on page\n331 in the guise of an image resizing service.\nCausality imposes an ordering on events: cause comes before effect; a message is sent\nbefore that message is received; the question comes before the answer. And, like in\nreal life, one thing leads to another: one node reads some data and then writes some\u2010\nthing as a result, another node reads the thing that was written and writes something\nelse in turn, and so on.

The answer is\nthat linearizability implies  causality: any system that is linearizable will preserve cau\u2010\nsality correctly [ 7]. In particular, if there are multiple communication channels in a\nsystem (such as the message queue and the file storage service in Figure 9-5 ), lineariz\u2010\nability ensures that causality is automatically preserved without the system having to\ndo anything special (such as passing around timestamps between different compo\u2010\nnents).\nThe fact that linearizability ensures causality is what makes linearizable systems sim\u2010\nple to understand and appealing.

Thus, when a replica processes an operation,\nit must ensure that all causally preceding operations (all operations that happened\nbefore) have already been processed; if some preceding operation is missing, the later\noperation must wait until the preceding operation has been processed.\nIn order to determine causal dependencies, we need some way of describing the\n\u201cknowledge\u201d of a node in the system.

Concurrent\noperations may be ordered arbitrarily. Such a total order captures all the causality\ninformation, but also imposes more ordering than strictly required by causality.\nIn a database with single-leader replication (see \u201cLeaders and Followers\u201d on page\n152), the replication log defines a total order of write operations that is consistent\nwith causality.

The advantage of Lamport timestamps over version vectors is\nthat they are more compact. \nTimestamp ordering is not sufficient\nAlthough Lamport timestamps define a total order of operations that is consistent\nwith causality, they are not quite sufficient to solve many common problems in dis\u2010\ntributed systems.\nFor example, consider a system that needs to ensure that a username uniquely identi\u2010\nfies a user account. If two users concurrently try to create an account with the same\nusername, one of the two should succeed and the other should fail. (We touched on\nthis problem previously in \u201cThe leader and the lock\u201d on page 301 .)\nAt first glance, it seems as though a total ordering of operations (e.g., using Lamport\ntimestamps) should be sufficient to solve this problem: if two accounts with the same\nusername are created, pick the one with the lower timestamp as the winner (the one\nwho grabbed the username first), and let the one with the greater timestamp fail.\nSince timestamps are totally ordered, this comparison is always valid.\nThis approach works for determining the winner after the fact: once you have collec\u2010\nted all the username creation operations in the system, you can compare their time\u2010\nstamps. However, it is not sufficient when a node has just received a request from a\nuser to create a username, and needs to decide right now  whether the request should\nsucceed or fail. At that moment, the node does not know whether another node is\nconcurrently in the process of creating an account with the same username, and what\ntimestamp that other node may assign to the operation.\nIn order to be sure that no other node is in the process of concurrently creating an\naccount with the same username and a lower timestamp, you would have to check\nwith every other node to see what it is doing [ 56]. If one of the other nodes has failed\nor cannot be reached due to a network problem, this system would grind to a halt.\nThis is not the kind of fault-tolerant system that we need.\nThe problem here is that the total order of operations only emerges after you have\ncollected all of the operations. If another node has generated some operations, but\nyou don\u2019t yet know what they are, you cannot construct the final ordering of opera\u2010\ntions: the unknown operations from the other node may need to be inserted at vari\u2010\nous positions in the total order.\nTo conclude: in order to implement something like a uniqueness constraint for user\u2010\nnames, it\u2019s not sufficient to have a total ordering of operations\u2014you also need to\nknow when that order is finalized.

This fact is a hint that there is a strong connection between total order\nbroadcast and consensus, which we will explore later in this chapter.\nTotal order broadcast is exactly what you need for database replication: if every mes\u2010\nsage represents a write to the database, and every replica processes the same writes in\nthe same order, then the replicas will remain consistent with each other (aside from\nany temporary replication lag). This principle is known as state machine replication\n[60], and we will return to it in Chapter 11 .\nSimilarly, total order broadcast can be used to implement serializable transactions: as\ndiscussed in \u201cActual Serial Execution\u201d on page 252, if every message represents a\ndeterministic transaction to be executed as a stored procedure, and if every node pro\u2010\ncesses those messages in the same order, then the partitions and replicas of the data\u2010\nbase are kept consistent with each other [ 61].\nAn important aspect of total order broadcast is that the order is fixed at the time the\nmessages are delivered: a node is not allowed to retroactively insert a message into an\nearlier position in the order if subsequent messages have already been delivered. This\nfact makes total order broadcast stronger than timestamp ordering.\nAnother way of looking at total order broadcast is that it is a way of creating a log (as\nin a replication log, transaction log, or write-ahead log): delivering a message is like\nappending to the log. Since all nodes must deliver the same messages in the same\norder, all nodes can read the log and see the same sequence of messages.\nTotal order broadcast is also useful for implementing a lock service that provides\nfencing tokens (see \u201cFencing tokens\u201d on page 303). Every request to acquire the lock\nis appended as a message to the log, and all messages are sequentially numbered in\nthe order they appear in the log.

Does that mean linearizability is the same as total order broadcast? Not quite,\nbut there are close links between the two.x \nTotal order broadcast is asynchronous: messages are guaranteed to be delivered relia\u2010\nbly in a fixed order, but there is no guarantee about when  a message will be delivered\n(so one recipient may lag behind the others). By contrast, linearizability is a recency\nguarantee: a read is guaranteed to see the latest value written.\nHowever, if you have total order broadcast, you can build linearizable storage on top\nof it. For example, you can ensure that usernames uniquely identify user accounts.\nImagine that for every possible username, you can have a linearizable register with an\natomic compare-and-set operation. Every register initially has the value null  (indi\u2010\ncating that the username is not taken). When a user wants to create a username, you\nexecute a compare-and-set operation on the register for that username, setting it to\nthe user account ID, under the condition that the previous register value is null . If\nmultiple users try to concurrently grab the same username, only one of the compare-\nand-set operations will succeed, because the others will see a value other than null\n(due to linearizability).\nYou can implement such a linearizable compare-and-set operation as follows by\nusing total order broadcast as an append-only log [ 62, 63]:\n1.Append a message to the log, tentatively indicating the username you want to\nclaim.\n2.Read the log, and wait for the message you appended to be delivered back to\nyou.xi\n3.Check for any messages claiming the username that you want. If the first message\nfor your desired username is your own message, then you are successful: you can\ncommit the username claim (perhaps by appending another message to the log)\nand acknowledge it to the client. If the first message for your desired username is\nfrom another user, you abort the operation.\n350 | Chapter 9: Consistency and Consensus",

Alternatively, an atomic\ncompare-and-set operation would also do the job.\nThe algorithm is simple: for every message you want to send through total order\nbroadcast, you increment-and-get the linearizable integer, and then attach the value\nyou got from the register as a sequence number to the message. You can then send\nthe message to all nodes (resending any lost messages), and the recipients will deliver\nthe messages consecutively by sequence number.\nNote that unlike Lamport timestamps, the numbers you get from incrementing the\nlinearizable register form a sequence with no gaps.

If the algorithm is\nallowed to use timeouts, or some other way of identifying suspected crashed nodes\n(even if the suspicion is sometimes wrong), then consensus becomes solvable [ 67].\nEven just allowing the algorithm to use random numbers is sufficient to get around\nthe impossibility result [ 69].\nThus, although the FLP result about the impossibility of consensus is of great theoret\u2010\nical importance, distributed systems can usually achieve consensus in practice.\nIn this section we will first examine the atomic commit problem in more detail.

The outcome of a transaction is either a successful commit , in which case\nall of the transaction\u2019s writes are made durable, or an abort , in which case all of the\ntransaction\u2019s writes are rolled back (i.e., undone or discarded).\nAtomicity prevents failed transactions from littering the database with half-finished\nresults and half-updated state. This is especially important for multi-object transac\u2010\ntions (see \u201cSingle-Object and Multi-Object Operations\u201d on page 228) and databases\nthat maintain secondary indexes. Each secondary index is a separate data structure\nfrom the primary data\u2014thus, if you modify some data, the corresponding change\nneeds to also be made in the secondary index. Atomicity ensures that the secondary\nindex stays consistent with the primary data (if the index became inconsistent with\nthe primary data, it would not be very useful).\nFrom single-node to distributed atomic commit\nFor transactions that execute at a single database node, atomicity is commonly imple\u2010\nmented by the storage engine. When the client asks the database node to commit the\ntransaction, the database makes the transaction\u2019s writes durable (typically in a write-\nahead log; see \u201cMaking B-trees reliable\u201d on page 82) and then appends a commit\nrecord to the log on disk. If the database crashes in the middle of this process, the\ntransaction is recovered from the log when the node restarts: if the commit record\nwas successfully written to disk before the crash, the transaction is considered com\u2010\nmitted; if not, any writes from that transaction are rolled back.\nThus, on a single node, transaction commitment crucially depends on the order  in\nwhich data is durably written to disk: first the data, then the commit record [ 72]. The\nkey deciding moment for whether the transaction commits or aborts is the moment\nat which the disk finishes writing the commit record: before that moment, it is still\npossible to abort (due to a crash), but after that moment, the transaction is commit\u2010\nted (even if the database crashes). Thus, it is a single device (the controller of one par\u2010\nticular disk drive, attached to one particular node) that makes the commit atomic.\nHowever, what if multiple nodes are involved in a transaction? For example, perhaps\nyou have a multi-object transaction in a partitioned database, or a term-partitioned\nsecondary index (in which the index entry may be on a different node from the pri\u2010\nmary data; see \u201cPartitioning and Secondary Indexes\u201d on page 206).

Surely the prepare\nand commit requests can just as easily be lost in the two-phase case. What makes 2PC\ndifferent?\nTo understand why it works, we have to break down the process in a bit more detail:\n1.When the application wants to begin a distributed transaction, it requests a\ntransaction ID from the coordinator. This transaction ID is globally unique.\n2.The application begins a single-node transaction on each of the participants, and\nattaches the globally unique transaction ID to the single-node transaction. All\nreads and writes are done in one of these single-node transactions. If anything\ngoes wrong at this stage (for example, a node crashes or a request times out), the\ncoordinator or any of the participants can abort.\n3.When the application is ready to commit, the coordinator sends a prepare\nrequest to all participants, tagged with the global transaction ID. If any of these\nrequests fails or times out, the coordinator sends an abort request for that trans\u2010\naction ID to all participants.\n4.When a participant receives the prepare request, it makes sure that it can defi\u2010\nnitely commit the transaction under all circumstances. This includes writing all\ntransaction data to disk (a crash, a power failure, or running out of disk space is\nnot an acceptable excuse for refusing to commit later), and checking for any con\u2010\nflicts or constraint violations. By replying \u201cyes\u201d to the coordinator, the node\npromises to commit the transaction without error if requested. In other words,\nthe participant surrenders the right to abort the transaction, but without actually\ncommitting it.\n5.When the coordinator has received responses to all prepare requests, it makes a\ndefinitive decision on whether to commit or abort the transaction (committing\nonly if all participants voted \u201cyes\u201d). The coordinator must write that decision to\nits transaction log on disk so that it knows which way it decided in case it subse\u2010\nquently crashes.

Bindings for this API exist in other languages; for example, in the world\nof Java EE applications, XA transactions are implemented using the Java Transaction\nAPI (JTA), which in turn is supported by many drivers for databases using Java Data\u2010\nbase Connectivity (JDBC) and drivers for message brokers using the Java Message\nService (JMS) APIs.\nXA assumes that your application uses a network driver or client library to commu\u2010\nnicate with the participant databases or messaging services. If the driver supports XA,\nthat means it calls the XA API to find out whether an operation should be part of a\ndistributed transaction\u2014and if so, it sends the necessary information to the database\nserver.

This election is given an incremented epoch number, and thus\nepoch numbers are totally ordered and monotonically increasing. If there is a conflict\nbetween two different leaders in two different epochs (perhaps because the previous\nleader actually wasn\u2019t dead after all), then the leader with the higher epoch number\nprevails.\nBefore a leader is allowed to decide anything, it must first check that there isn\u2019t some\nother leader with a higher epoch number which might take a conflicting decision.\nHow does a leader know that it hasn\u2019t been ousted by another node? Recall \u201cThe\nTruth Is Defined by the Majority\u201d on page 300: a node cannot necessarily trust its\nown judgment\u2014just because a node thinks that it is the leader, that does not neces\u2010\nsarily mean the other nodes accept it as their leader.\nInstead, it must collect votes from a quorum  of nodes (see \u201cQuorums for reading and\nwriting\u201d  on page 179). For every decision that a leader wants to make, it must send\nthe proposed value to the other nodes and wait for a quorum of nodes to respond in\nfavor of the proposal. The quorum typically, but not always, consists of a majority of\nnodes [ 105]. A node votes in favor of a proposal only if it is not aware of any other\nleader with a higher epoch.\nThus, we have two rounds of voting: once to choose a leader, and a second time to\nvote on a leader\u2019s proposal. The key insight is that the quorums for those two votes\nmust overlap: if a vote on a proposal succeeds, at least one of the nodes that voted for\nit must have also participated in the most recent leader election [ 105]. Thus, if the\nvote on a proposal does not reveal any higher-numbered epoch, the current leader\ncan conclude that no leader election with a higher epoch number has happened, and\ntherefore be sure that it still holds the leadership. It can then safely decide the pro\u2010\nposed value.\nThis voting process looks superficially similar to two-phase commit.

As discussed in \u201cSynchronous Versus Asynchronous Repli\u2010\ncation\u201d  on page 153, databases are often configured to use asynchronous replication.\nIn this configuration, some committed data can potentially be lost on failover\u2014but\nmany people choose to accept this risk for the sake of better performance.\nConsensus systems always require a strict majority to operate. This means you need a\nminimum of three nodes in order to tolerate one failure (the remaining two out of\nthree form a majority), or a minimum of five nodes to tolerate two failures (the\nremaining three out of five form a majority). If a network failure cuts off some nodes\nfrom the rest, only the majority portion of the network can make progress, and the\nrest is blocked (see also \u201cThe Cost of Linearizability\u201d on page 335 ).\nMost consensus algorithms assume a fixed set of nodes that participate in voting,\nwhich means that you can\u2019t just add or remove nodes in the cluster. Dynamic mem\u2010\nbership  extensions to consensus algorithms allow the set of nodes in the cluster to\nchange over time, but they are much less well understood than static membership\nalgorithms.\nConsensus systems generally rely on timeouts to detect failed nodes. In environments\nwith highly variable network delays, especially geographically distributed systems, it\noften happens that a node falsely believes the leader to have failed due to a transient\nnetwork issue. Although this error does not harm the safety properties, frequent\nleader elections result in terrible performance because the system can end up spend\u2010\ning more time choosing a leader than doing any useful work.\nSometimes, consensus algorithms are particularly sensitive to network problems. For\nexample, Raft has been shown to have unpleasant edge cases [ 106]: if the entire net\u2010\nwork is working correctly except for one particular network link that is consistently\nunreliable, Raft can get into situations where leadership continually bounces between\ntwo nodes, or the current leader is continually forced to resign, so the system effec\u2010\ntively never makes progress.

What is it that these projects get from it?\nZooKeeper and etcd are designed to hold small amounts of data that can fit entirely\nin memory (although they still write to disk for durability)\u2014so you wouldn\u2019t want to\nstore all of your application\u2019s data here. That small amount of data is replicated\nacross all the nodes using a fault-tolerant total order broadcast algorithm. As dis\u2010\ncussed previously, total order broadcast is just what you need for database replica\u2010\ntion: if each message represents a write to the database, applying the same writes in\nthe same order keeps replicas consistent with each other.\nZooKeeper is modeled after Google\u2019s Chubby lock service [ 14, 98], implementing not\nonly total order broadcast (and hence consensus), but also an interesting set of other\nfeatures that turn out to be particularly useful when building distributed systems:\nLinearizable atomic operations\nUsing an atomic compare-and-set operation, you can implement a lock: if several\nnodes concurrently try to perform the same operation, only one of them will suc\u2010\nceed. The consensus protocol guarantees that the operation will be atomic and\nlinearizable, even if a node fails or the network is interrupted at any point. A dis\u2010\ntributed lock is usually implemented as a lease , which has an expiry time so that\nit is eventually released in case the client fails (see \u201cProcess Pauses\u201d on page 295 ).\nTotal ordering of operations\nAs discussed in \u201cThe leader and the lock\u201d on page 301, when some resource is\nprotected by a lock or lease, you need a fencing token  to prevent clients from con\u2010\nflicting with each other in the case of a process pause. The fencing token is some\nnumber that monotonically increases every time the lock is acquired. ZooKeeper\nprovides this by totally ordering all operations and giving each operation a\nmonotonically increasing transaction ID ( zxid ) and version number ( cversion )\n[15].\n370 | Chapter 9: Consistency and Consensus",

    "chunk": "Failure detection\nClients maintain a long-lived session on ZooKeeper servers, and the client and\nserver periodically exchange heartbeats to check that the other node is still alive.\nEven if the connection is temporarily interrupted, or a ZooKeeper node fails, the\nsession remains active. However, if the heartbeats cease for a duration that is\nlonger than the session timeout, ZooKeeper declares the session to be dead. Any\nlocks held by a session can be configured to be automatically released when the\nsession times out (ZooKeeper calls these ephemeral nodes ).\nChange notifications\nNot only can one client read locks and values that were created by another client,\nbut it can also watch them for changes. Thus, a client can find out when another\nclient joins the cluster (based on the value it writes to ZooKeeper), or if another\nclient fails (because its session times out and its ephemeral nodes disappear). By\nsubscribing to notifications, a client avoids having to frequently poll to find out\nabout changes.\nOf these features, only the linearizable atomic operations really require consensus.\nHowever, it is the combination of these features that makes systems like ZooKeeper\nso useful for distributed coordination.\nAllocating work to nodes\nOne example in which the ZooKeeper/Chubby model works well is if you have sev\u2010\neral instances of a process or service, and one of them needs to be chosen as leader or\nprimary. If the leader fails, one of the other nodes should take over. This is of course\nuseful for single-leader databases, but it\u2019s also useful for job schedulers and similar\nstateful systems.\nAnother example arises when you have some partitioned resource (database, message\nstreams, file storage, distributed actor system, etc.) and need to decide which parti\u2010\ntion to assign to which node. As new nodes join the cluster, some of the partitions\nneed to be moved from existing nodes to the new nodes in order to rebalance the\nload (see \u201cRebalancing Partitions\u201d on page 209). As nodes are removed or fail, other\nnodes need to take over the failed nodes\u2019 work.\nThese kinds of tasks can be achieved by judicious use of atomic operations, ephem\u2010\neral nodes, and notifications in ZooKeeper. If done correctly, this approach allows\nthe application to automatically recover from faults without human intervention. It\u2019s\nnot easy, despite the appearance of libraries such as Apache Curator [ 17] that have\nsprung up to provide higher-level tools on top of the ZooKeeper client API\u2014but it is\nstill much better than attempting to implement the necessary consensus algorithms\nfrom scratch, which has a poor success record [ 107].\nDistributed Transactions and Consensus | 371",

    "chunk": "An application may initially run only on a single node, but eventually may grow to\nthousands of nodes. Trying to perform majority votes over so many nodes would be\nterribly inefficient. Instead, ZooKeeper runs on a fixed number of nodes (usually\nthree or five) and performs its majority votes among those nodes while supporting a\npotentially large number of clients. Thus, ZooKeeper provides a way of \u201coutsourcing\u201d\nsome of the work of coordinating nodes (consensus, operation ordering, and failure\ndetection) to an external service.\nNormally, the kind of data managed by ZooKeeper is quite slow-changing: it repre\u2010\nsents information like \u201cthe node running on 10.1.1.23 is the leader for partition 7,\u201d\nwhich may change on a timescale of minutes or hours. It is not intended for storing\nthe runtime state of the application, which may change thousands or even millions of\ntimes per second. If application state needs to be replicated from one node to\nanother, other tools (such as Apache BookKeeper [ 108]) can be used.\nService discovery\nZooKeeper, etcd, and Consul are also often used for service discovery \u2014that is, to find\nout which IP address you need to connect to in order to reach a particular service. In\ncloud datacenter environments, where it is common for virtual machines to continu\u2010\nally come and go, you often don\u2019t know the IP addresses of your services ahead of\ntime. Instead, you can configure your services such that when they start up they reg\u2010\nister their network endpoints in a service registry, where they can then be found by\nother services.\nHowever, it is less clear whether service discovery actually requires consensus. DNS is\nthe traditional way of looking up the IP address for a service name, and it uses multi\u2010\nple layers of caching to achieve good performance and availability. Reads from DNS\nare absolutely not linearizable, and it is usually not considered problematic if the\nresults from a DNS query are a little stale [ 109]. It is more important that DNS is reli\u2010\nably available and robust to network interruptions.\nAlthough service discovery does not require consensus, leader election does. Thus, if\nyour consensus system already knows who the leader is, then it can make sense to\nalso use that information to help other services discover who the leader is. For this\npurpose, some consensus systems support read-only caching replicas. These replicas\nasynchronously receive the log of all decisions of the consensus algorithm, but do not\nactively participate in voting. They are therefore able to serve read requests that do\nnot need to be linearizable.\nMembership services\nZooKeeper and friends can be seen as part of a long history of research into member\u2010\nship services , which goes back to the 1980s and has been important for building\nhighly reliable systems, e.g., for air traffic control [ 110].\n372 | Chapter 9: Consistency and Consensus",

As we saw throughout Chapter 8 , due to unbounded network delays it\u2019s\nnot possible to reliably detect whether another node has failed. However, if you cou\u2010\nple failure detection with consensus, nodes can come to an agreement about which\nnodes should be considered alive or not.\nIt could still happen that a node is incorrectly declared dead by consensus, even\nthough it is actually alive. But it is nevertheless very useful for a system to have agree\u2010\nment on which nodes constitute the current membership. For example, choosing a\nleader could mean simply choosing the lowest-numbered among the current mem\u2010\nbers, but this approach would not work if different nodes have divergent opinions on\nwho the current members are. \nSummary\nIn this chapter we examined the topics of consistency and consensus from several dif\u2010\nferent angles. We looked in depth at linearizability, a popular consistency model: its\ngoal is to make replicated data appear as though there were only a single copy, and to\nmake all operations act on it atomically. Although linearizability is appealing because\nit is easy to understand\u2014it makes a database behave like a variable in a single-\nthreaded program\u2014it has the downside of being slow, especially in environments\nwith large network delays.\nWe also explored causality, which imposes an ordering on events in a system (what\nhappened before what, based on cause and effect). Unlike linearizability, which puts\nall operations in a single, totally ordered timeline, causality provides us with a weaker\nconsistency model: some things can be concurrent, so the version history is like a\ntimeline with branching and merging. Causal consistency does not have the coordi\u2010\nnation overhead of linearizability and is much less sensitive to network problems.\nHowever, even if we capture the causal ordering (for example using Lamport time\u2010\nstamps), we saw that some things cannot be implemented this way: in \u201cTimestamp\nordering is not sufficient\u201d on page 347 we considered the example of ensuring that a\nusername is unique and rejecting concurrent registrations for the same username. If\none node is going to accept a registration, it needs to somehow know that another\nnode isn\u2019t concurrently in the process of registering the same name. This problem led\nus toward consensus .\nWe saw that achieving consensus means deciding something in such a way that all\nnodes agree on what was decided, and such that the decision is irrevocable. With\nsome digging, it turns out that a wide range of problems are actually reducible to\nconsensus and are equivalent to each other (in the sense that if you have a solution\nfor one of them, you can easily transform it into a solution for one of the others).\nSuch equivalent problems include:\nSummary | 373",

However, this\ndiscussion assumed that there was only one database in the application.\nIn reality, data systems are often more complex.

When new data comes in, e.g., as user input, it is first written here.\nEach fact is represented exactly once (the representation is typically normalized ).\nIf there is any discrepancy between another system and the system of record,\nthen the value in the system of record is (by definition) the correct one.\nDerived data systems\nData in a derived system is the result of taking some existing data from another\nsystem and transforming or processing it in some way. If you lose derived data,\nyou can recreate it from the original source. A classic example is a cache: data can\nbe served from the cache if present, but if the cache doesn\u2019t contain what you\nneed, you can fall back to the underlying database. Denormalized values, indexes,\nand materialized views also fall into this category. In recommendation systems,\npredictive summary data is often derived from usage logs.\nTechnically speaking, derived data is redundant , in the sense that it duplicates exist\u2010\ning information. However, it is often essential for getting good performance on read\nqueries. It is commonly denormalized . You can derive several different datasets from\na single source, enabling you to look at the data from different \u201cpoints of view.\u201d\nNot all systems make a clear distinction between systems of record and derived data\nin their architecture, but it\u2019s a very helpful distinction to make, because it clarifies the\ndataflow through your system: it makes explicit which parts of the system have which\ninputs and which outputs, and how they depend on each other.\nMost databases, storage engines, and query languages are not inherently either a sys\u2010\ntem of record or a derived system. A database is just a tool: how you use it is up to\nyou. The distinction between system of record and derived data system depends not\non the tool, but on how you use it in your application.\nBy being clear about which data is derived from which other data, you can bring\nclarity to an otherwise confusing system architecture.

    "chunk": "CHAPTER 10\nBatch Processing\nA system cannot be successful if it is too strongly influenced by a single person. Once the\ninitial design is complete and fairly robust, the real test begins as people with many different\nviewpoints undertake their own experiments.\n\u2014Donald Knuth\nIn the first two parts of this book we talked a lot about requests  and queries , and the\ncorresponding responses  or results . This style of data processing is assumed in many\nmodern data systems: you ask for something, or you send an instruction, and some\ntime later the system (hopefully) gives you an answer. Databases, caches, search\nindexes, web servers, and many other systems work this way.\nIn such online  systems, whether it\u2019s a web browser requesting a page or a service call\u2010\ning a remote API, we generally assume that the request is triggered by a human user,\nand that the user is waiting for the response. They shouldn\u2019t have to wait too long, so\nwe pay a lot of attention to the response time  of these systems (see \u201cDescribing Perfor\u2010\nmance\u201d on page 13 ).\nThe web, and increasing numbers of HTTP/REST-based APIs, has made the request/\nresponse style of interaction so common that it\u2019s easy to take it for granted. But we\nshould remember that it\u2019s not the only way of building systems, and that other\napproaches have their merits too. Let\u2019s distinguish three different types of systems:\nServices (online systems)\nA service waits for a request or instruction from a client to arrive. When one is\nreceived, the service tries to handle it as quickly as possible and sends a response\nback. Response time is usually the primary measure of performance of a service,\nand availability is often very important (if the client can\u2019t reach the service, the\nuser will probably get an error message).\n389",

Furthermore, availability is critical, as the user's ability to reach the service dictates their perceived performance.

    "chunk": "Batch processing systems (offline systems)\nA batch processing system takes a large amount of input data, runs a job to pro\u2010\ncess it, and produces some output data. Jobs often take a while (from a few\nminutes to several days), so there normally isn\u2019t a user waiting for the job to fin\u2010\nish. Instead, batch jobs are often scheduled to run periodically (for example, once\na day). The primary performance measure of a batch job is usually throughput\n(the time it takes to crunch through an input dataset of a certain size). We dis\u2010\ncuss batch processing in this chapter.\nStream processing systems (near-real-time systems)\nStream processing is somewhere between online and offline/batch processing (so\nit is sometimes called near-real-time  or nearline  processing). Like a batch pro\u2010\ncessing system, a stream processor consumes inputs and produces outputs\n(rather than responding to requests). However, a stream job operates on events\nshortly after they happen, whereas a batch job operates on a fixed set of input\ndata. This difference allows stream processing systems to have lower latency than\nthe equivalent batch systems. As stream processing builds upon batch process\u2010\ning, we discuss it in Chapter 11 .\nAs we shall see in this chapter, batch processing is an important building block in our\nquest to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications. For example, Map\u2010\nReduce, a batch processing algorithm published in 2004 [ 1], was (perhaps over-\nenthusiastically) called \u201cthe algorithm that makes Google so massively scalable\u201d [ 2]. It\nwas subsequently implemented in various open source data systems, including\nHadoop, CouchDB, and MongoDB.\nMapReduce is a fairly low-level programming model compared to the parallel pro\u2010\ncessing systems that were developed for data warehouses many years previously [ 3,\n4], but it was a major step forward in terms of the scale of processing that could be\nachieved on commodity hardware. Although the importance of MapReduce is now\ndeclining [ 5], it is still worth understanding, because it provides a clear picture of\nwhy and how batch processing is useful.\nIn fact, batch processing is a very old form of computing. Long before programmable\ndigital computers were invented, punch card tabulating machines\u2014such as the Hol\u2010\nlerith machines used in the 1890 US Census [ 6]\u2014implemented a semi-mechanized\nform of batch processing to compute aggregate statistics from large inputs. And Map\u2010\nReduce bears an uncanny resemblance to the electromechanical IBM card-sorting\nmachines that were widely used for business data processing in the 1940s and 1950s\n[7]. As usual, history has a tendency of repeating itself.\nIn this chapter, we will look at MapReduce and several other batch processing algo\u2010\nrithms and frameworks, and explore how they are used in modern data systems. But\nfirst, to get started, we will look at data processing using standard Unix tools. Even if\nyou are already familiar with them, a reminder about the Unix philosophy is worth\u2010\n390 | Chapter 10: Batch Processing",

The user was not authenticated, so $remote_user  is set to a hyphen\n(-). The response status was 200 (i.e., the request was successful), and the response\nwas 3,377 bytes in size.

The Unix pipeline example does not have\nsuch a hash table, but instead relies on sorting a list of URLs in which multiple occur\u2010\nrences of the same URL are simply repeated.\nWhich approach is better? It depends how many different URLs you have. For most\nsmall to mid-sized websites, you can probably fit all distinct URLs, and a counter for\neach URL, in (say) 1 GB of memory. In this example, the working set  of the job (the\namount of memory to which the job needs random access) depends only on the\nnumber of distinct URLs: if there are a million log entries for a single URL, the space\nrequired in the hash table is still just one URL plus the size of the counter. If this\nworking set is small enough, an in-memory hash table works fine\u2014even on a laptop.\nOn the other hand, if the job\u2019s working set is larger than the available memory, the\nsorting approach has the advantage that it can make efficient use of disks.

To do a new job, build afresh rather than\ncomplicate old programs by adding new \u201cfeatures\u201d.\n2.Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet\nunknown, program. Don\u2019t clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid\nstringently columnar or binary input formats. Don\u2019t insist on interactive input.\n3.Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within\nweeks.

A URL identifies\na particular thing (resource) on a website, and you can link to any URL from any other website. A user with a\nweb browser can thus seamlessly jump between websites by following links, even though the servers may be\noperated by entirely unrelated organizations. This principle seems obvious today, but it was a key insight in\nmaking the web the success that it is today. Prior systems were not so uniform: for example, in the era of\nbulletin board systems (BBSs), each system had its own phone number and baud rate configuration. A refer\u2010\nence from one BBS to another would have to be in the form of a phone number and modem settings; the user\nwould have to hang up, dial the other BBS, and then manually find the information they were looking for. It\nwasn\u2019t possible to link directly to some piece of content inside another BBS.The sort  tool is a great example of a program that does one thing well. It is arguably\na better sorting implementation than most programming languages have in their\nstandard libraries (which do not spill to disk and do not use multiple threads, even\nwhen that would be beneficial). And yet, sort  is barely useful in isolation. It only\nbecomes powerful in combination with the other Unix tools, such as uniq .\nA Unix shell like bash  lets us easily compose  these small programs into surprisingly\npowerful data processing jobs. Even though many of these programs are written by\ndifferent groups of people, they can be joined together in flexible ways. What does\nUnix do to enable this composability?\nA uniform interface\nIf you expect the output of one program to become the input to another program,\nthat means those programs must use the same data format\u2014in other words, a com\u2010\npatible interface. If you want to be able to connect any program\u2019s output to any pro\u2010\ngram\u2019s input, that means that all programs must use the same input/output interface.\nIn Unix, that interface is a file (or, more precisely, a file descriptor). A file is just an\nordered sequence of bytes. Because that is such a simple interface, many different\nthings can be represented using the same interface: an actual file on the filesystem, a\ncommunication channel to another process (Unix socket, stdin , stdout ), a device\ndriver (say /dev/audio  or /dev/lp0 ), a socket representing a TCP connection, and so\non. It\u2019s easy to take this for granted, but it\u2019s actually quite remarkable that these very\ndifferent things can share a uniform interface, so they can easily be plugged together.ii\nBy convention, many (but not all) Unix programs treat this sequence of bytes as\nASCII text. Our log analysis example used this fact: awk, sort , uniq , and head  all treat\ntheir input file as a list of records separated by the \\n (newline, ASCII 0x0A ) charac\u2010\nter. The choice of \\n is arbitrary\u2014arguably, the ASCII record separator 0x1E  would\nhave been a better choice, since it\u2019s intended for this purpose [ 14]\u2014but in any case,\nthe fact that all these programs have standardized on using the same record separator\nallows them to interoperate.\nBatch Processing with Unix Tools | 395",

We will return to this idea later.\nAlthough it\u2019s not perfect, even decades later, the uniform interface of Unix is still\nsomething remarkable. Not many pieces of software interoperate and compose as\nwell as Unix tools do: you can\u2019t easily pipe the contents of your email account and\nyour online shopping history through a custom analysis tool into a spreadsheet and\npost the results to a social network or a wiki.

This lack of integration leads to Balkanization of data.\nSeparation of logic and wiring\nAnother characteristic feature of Unix tools is their use of standard input ( stdin ) and\nstandard output ( stdout ). If you run a program and don\u2019t specify anything else,\nstdin  comes from the keyboard and stdout  goes to the screen. However, you can\nalso take input from a file and/or redirect output to a file. Pipes let you attach the\nstdout  of one process to the stdin  of another process (with a small in-memory\nbuffer, and without writing the entire intermediate data stream to disk).\nA program can still read and write files directly if it needs to, but the Unix approach\nworks best if a program doesn\u2019t worry about particular file paths and simply uses\nstdin  and stdout . This allows a shell user to wire up the input and output in what\u2010\never way they want; the program doesn\u2019t know or care where the input is coming\nfrom and where the output is going to. (One could say this is a form of loose coupling ,\nlate binding  [15], or inversion of control  [16].) Separating the input/output wiring\nfrom the program logic makes it easier to compose small tools into bigger systems.\nYou can even write your own programs and combine them with the tools provided\nby the operating system.

In the log analy\u2010\nsis example, you could write a tool that translates user-agent strings into more sensi\u2010\nble browser identifiers, or a tool that translates IP addresses into country codes, and\nsimply plug it into the pipeline.

One difference is that with HDFS, computing tasks can be scheduled to run on the machine that stores a\ncopy of a particular file, whereas object stores usually keep storage and computation separate. Reading from a\nlocal disk has a performance advantage if network bandwidth is a bottleneck. Note however that if erasure\ncoding is used, the locality advantage is lost, because the data from several machines must be combined in\norder to reconstitute the original file [ 20].files are written once, in a sequential fashion (not modifying any existing part of a file\nonce it has been written).\nWhile Unix tools use stdin  and stdout  as input and output, MapReduce jobs read\nand write files on a distributed filesystem. In Hadoop\u2019s implementation of Map\u2010\nReduce, that filesystem is called HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), an open\nsource reimplementation of the Google File System (GFS) [ 19].\nVarious other distributed filesystems besides HDFS exist, such as GlusterFS and the\nQuantcast File System (QFS) [ 20]. Object storage services such as Amazon S3, Azure\nBlob Storage, and OpenStack Swift [ 21] are similar in many ways.iv In this chapter we\nwill mostly use HDFS as a running example, but the principles apply to any dis\u2010\ntributed filesystem.\nHDFS is based on the shared-nothing  principle (see the introduction to Part II ), in\ncontrast to the shared-disk approach of Network Attached Storage  (NAS) and Storage\nArea Network  (SAN) architectures. Shared-disk storage is implemented by a central\u2010\nized storage appliance, often using custom hardware and special network infrastruc\u2010\nture such as Fibre Channel. On the other hand, the shared-nothing approach requires\nno special hardware, only computers connected by a conventional datacenter net\u2010\nwork.\nHDFS consists of a daemon process running on each machine, exposing a network\nservice that allows other nodes to access files stored on that machine (assuming that\nevery general-purpose machine in a datacenter has some disks attached to it). A cen\u2010\ntral server called the NameNode  keeps track of which file blocks are stored on which\nmachine. Thus, HDFS conceptually creates one big filesystem that can use the space\non the disks of all machines running the daemon.\nIn order to tolerate machine and disk failures, file blocks are replicated on multiple\nmachines. Replication may mean simply several copies of the same data on multiple\nmachines, as in Chapter 5 , or an erasure coding  scheme such as Reed\u2013Solomon codes,\nwhich allows lost data to be recovered with lower storage overhead than full replica\u2010\ntion [ 20, 22]. The techniques are similar to RAID, which provides redundancy across\nseveral disks attached to the same machine; the difference is that in a distributed file\u2010\nsystem, file access and replication are done over a conventional datacenter network\nwithout special hardware.\n398 | Chapter 10: Batch Processing",

The easiest way of understanding\nit is by referring back to the web server log analysis example in \u201cSimple Log Analysis\u201d\non page 391. The pattern of data processing in MapReduce is very similar to this\nexample:\n1.Read a set of input files, and break it up into records . In the web server log exam\u2010\nple, each record is one line in the log (that is, \\n is the record separator).\n2.Call the mapper function to extract a key and value from each input record. In\nthe preceding example, the mapper function is awk '{print $7}' : it extracts the\nURL ($7) as the key, and leaves the value empty.\n3.Sort all of the key-value pairs by key. In the log example, this is done by the first\nsort  command.\n4.Call the reducer function to iterate over the sorted key-value pairs. If there are\nmultiple occurrences of the same key, the sorting has made them adjacent in the\nlist, so it is easy to combine those values without having to keep a lot of state in\nmemory. In the preceding example, the reducer is implemented by the command\nuniq -c , which counts the number of adjacent records with the same key.\nThose four steps can be performed by one MapReduce job. Steps 2 (map) and 4\n(reduce) are where you write your custom data processing code. Step 1 (breaking files\ninto records) is handled by the input format parser. Step 3, the sort  step, is implicit\nin MapReduce\u2014you don\u2019t have to write it, because the output from the mapper is\nalways sorted before it is given to the reducer.\nTo create a MapReduce job, you need to implement two callback functions, the map\u2010\nper and reducer, which behave as follows (see also \u201cMapReduce Querying\u201d  on page\n46):\nMapper\nThe mapper is called once for every input record, and its job is to extract the key\nand value from the input record.

Workflows consisting of 50 to 100 MapReduce jobs are\ncommon when building recommendation systems [ 29], and in a large organization,\nmany different teams may be running different jobs that read each other\u2019s output.\nTool support is important for managing such complex dataflows.\nVarious higher-level tools for Hadoop, such as Pig [ 30], Hive [ 31], Cascading [ 32],\nCrunch [ 33], and FlumeJava [ 34], also set up workflows of multiple MapReduce\nstages that are automatically wired together appropriately. \nReduce-Side Joins and Grouping\nWe discussed joins in Chapter 2  in the context of data models and query languages,\nbut we have not delved into how joins are actually implemented. It is time that we\npick up that thread again.\nIn many datasets it is common for one record to have an association with another\nrecord: a foreign key  in a relational model, a document reference  in a document\nmodel, or an edge  in a graph model. A join is necessary whenever you have some\ncode that needs to access records on both sides of that association (both the record\nthat holds the reference and the record being referenced). As discussed in Chapter 2 ,\ndenormalization can reduce the need for joins but generally not remove it entirely.v\nIn a database, if you execute a query that involves only a small number of records, the\ndatabase will typically use an index  to quickly locate the records of interest (see Chap\u2010\nter 3 ). If the query involves joins, it may require multiple index lookups. However,\nMapReduce has no concept of indexes\u2014at least not in the usual sense.\nWhen a MapReduce job is given a set of files as input, it reads the entire content of all\nof those files; a database would call this operation a full table scan . If you only want to\nread a small number of records, a full table scan is outrageously expensive compared\nto an index lookup. However, in analytic queries (see \u201cTransaction Processing or\nAnalytics?\u201d  on page 90) it is common to want to calculate aggregates over a large\nnumber of records. In this case, scanning the entire input might be quite a reasonable\nthing to do, especially if you can parallelize the processing across multiple machines.\nMapReduce and Distributed Filesystems | 403",

In general, the hash table may need to contain\nseveral entries with the same key, and the join operator will output all matches for a key.Broadcast hash joins\nThe simplest way of performing a map-side join applies in the case where a large\ndataset is joined with a small dataset. In particular, the small dataset needs to be small\nenough that it can be loaded entirely into memory in each of the mappers.\nFor example, imagine in the case of Figure 10-2  that the user database is small\nenough to fit in memory. In this case, when a mapper starts up, it can first read the\nuser database from the distributed filesystem into an in-memory hash table. Once\nthis is done, the mapper can scan over the user activity events and simply look up the\nuser ID for each event in the hash table.vi\nThere can still be several map tasks: one for each file block of the large input to the\njoin (in the example of Figure 10-2 , the activity events are the large input). Each of\nthese mappers loads the small input entirely into memory.\nThis simple but effective algorithm is called a broadcast hash join : the word broadcast\nreflects the fact that each mapper for a partition of the large input reads the entirety\nof the small input (so the small input is effectively \u201cbroadcast\u201d to all partitions of the\nlarge input), and the word hash  reflects its use of a hash table. This join method is\nsupported by Pig (under the name \u201creplicated join\u201d), Hive (\u201cMapJoin\u201d), Cascading,\nand Crunch. It is also used in data warehouse query engines such as Impala [ 41].\nInstead of loading the small join input into an in-memory hash table, an alternative is\nto store the small join input in a read-only index on the local disk [ 42]. The fre\u2010\nquently used parts of this index will remain in the operating system\u2019s page cache, so\nthis approach can provide random-access lookups almost as fast as an in-memory\nhash table, but without actually requiring the dataset to fit in memory.\nPartitioned hash joins\nIf the inputs to the map-side join are partitioned in the same way, then the hash join\napproach can be applied to each partition independently. In the case of Figure 10-2 ,\nyou might arrange for the activity events and the user database to each be partitioned\nbased on the last decimal digit of the user ID (so there are 10 partitions on either\nside). For example, mapper 3 first loads all users with an ID ending in 3 into a hash\ntable, and then scans over all the activity events for each user whose ID ends in 3.\nIf the partitioning is done correctly, you can be sure that all the records you might\nwant to join are located in the same numbered partition, and so it is sufficient for\neach mapper to only read one partition from each of the input datasets.

On\nthe other hand, analytic queries often scan over a large number of records, perform\u2010\ning groupings and aggregations, and the output often has the form of a report: a\ngraph showing the change in a metric over time, or the top 10 items according to\nsome ranking, or a breakdown of some quantity into subcategories. The consumer of\nsuch a report is often an analyst or a manager who needs to make business decisions.\nWhere does batch processing fit in? It is not transaction processing, nor is it analyt\u2010\nics. It is closer to analytics, in that a batch process typically scans over large portions\nof an input dataset. However, a workflow of MapReduce jobs is not the same as a\nSQL query used for analytic purposes (see \u201cComparing Hadoop to Distributed Data\u2010\nbases\u201d  on page 414). The output of a batch process is often not a report, but some\nother kind of structure.\nBuilding search indexes\nGoogle\u2019s original use of MapReduce was to build indexes for its search engine, which\nwas implemented as a workflow of 5 to 10 MapReduce jobs [ 1]. Although Google\nlater moved away from using MapReduce for this purpose [ 43], it helps to under\u2010\nstand MapReduce if you look at it through the lens of building a search index. (Even\ntoday, Hadoop MapReduce remains a good way of building indexes for Lucene/Solr\n[44].)\nWe saw briefly in \u201cFull-text search and fuzzy indexes\u201d on page 88 how a full-text\nsearch index such as Lucene works: it is a file (the term dictionary) in which you can\nefficiently look up a particular keyword and find the list of all the document IDs con\u2010\ntaining that keyword (the postings list). This is a very simplified view of a search\nindex\u2014in reality it requires various additional data, in order to rank search results by\nrelevance, correct misspellings, resolve synonyms, and so on\u2014but the principle\nholds.\nIf you need to perform a full-text search over a fixed set of documents, then a batch\nprocess is a very effective way of building the indexes: the mappers partition the set of\ndocuments as needed, each reducer builds the index for its partition, and the index\nfiles are written to the distributed filesystem. Building such document-partitioned\nindexes (see \u201cPartitioning and Secondary Indexes\u201d on page 206 ) parallelizes very well.\nMapReduce and Distributed Filesystems | 411",

This approach can be compu\u2010\ntationally expensive if only a small number of documents have changed, but it has the\nadvantage that the indexing process is very easy to reason about: documents in,\nindexes out.\nAlternatively, it is possible to build indexes incrementally.

We will see more on such incremental processing in Chapter 11 .\nKey-value stores as batch process output\nSearch indexes are just one example of the possible outputs of a batch processing\nworkflow. Another common use for batch processing is to build machine learning\nsystems such as classifiers (e.g., spam filters, anomaly detection, image recognition)\nand recommendation systems (e.g., people you may know, products you may be\ninterested in, or related searches [ 29]).\nThe output of those batch jobs is often some kind of database: for example, a data\u2010\nbase that can be queried by user ID to obtain suggested friends for that user, or a\ndatabase that can be queried by product ID to get a list of related products [ 45].\nThese databases need to be queried from the web application that handles user\nrequests, which is usually separate from the Hadoop infrastructure. So how does the\noutput from the batch process get back into a database where the web application can\nquery it?\nThe most obvious choice might be to use the client library for your favorite database\ndirectly within a mapper or reducer, and to write from the batch job directly to the\ndatabase server, one record at a time. This will work (assuming your firewall rules\nallow direct access from your Hadoop environment to your production databases),\nbut it is a bad idea for several reasons:\n\u2022As discussed previously in the context of joins, making a network request for\nevery single record is orders of magnitude slower than the normal throughput of\na batch task.

This can in turn cause operational problems in other parts\nof the system [ 35].\n\u2022Normally, MapReduce provides a clean all-or-nothing guarantee for job output:\nif a job succeeds, the result is the output of running every task exactly once, even\nif some tasks failed and had to be retried along the way; if the entire job fails, no\noutput is produced. However, writing to an external system from inside a job\nproduces externally visible side effects that cannot be hidden in this way. Thus,\nyou have to worry about the results from partially completed jobs being visible to\nother systems, and the complexities of Hadoop task attempts and speculative\nexecution.\nA much better solution is to build a brand-new database inside  the batch job and\nwrite it as files to the job\u2019s output directory in the distributed filesystem, just like the\nsearch indexes in the last section. Those data files are then immutable once written,\nand can be loaded in bulk into servers that handle read-only queries. Various key-\nvalue stores support building database files in MapReduce jobs, including Voldemort\n[46], Terrapin [ 47], ElephantDB [ 48], and HBase bulk loading [ 49].\nBuilding these database files is a good use of MapReduce: using a mapper to extract a\nkey and then sorting by that key is already a lot of the work required to build an\nindex. Since most of these key-value stores are read-only (the files can only be written\nonce by a batch job and are then immutable), the data structures are quite simple. For\nexample, they do not require a WAL (see \u201cMaking B-trees reliable\u201d on page 82 ).\nWhen loading data into Voldemort, the server continues serving requests to the old\ndata files while the new data files are copied from the distributed filesystem to the\nserver\u2019s local disk. Once the copying is complete, the server atomically switches over\nto querying the new files. If anything goes wrong in this process, it can easily switch\nback to the old files again, since they are still there and immutable [ 46]. \nPhilosophy of batch process outputs\nThe Unix philosophy that we discussed earlier in this chapter ( \u201cThe Unix Philoso\u2010\nphy\u201d on page 394) encourages experimentation by being very explicit about dataflow:\na program reads its input and writes its output. In the process, the input is left\nunchanged, any previous output is completely replaced with the new output, and\nthere are no other side effects. This means that you can rerun a command as often as\nyou like, tweaking or debugging it, without messing up the state of your system.\nThe handling of output from MapReduce jobs follows the same philosophy. By treat\u2010\ning inputs as immutable and avoiding side effects (such as writing to external data\u2010\nbases), batch jobs not only achieve good performance but also become much easier to\nmaintain:\nMapReduce and Distributed Filesystems | 413",

Or, even simpler, you can keep the old output in a\ndifferent directory and simply switch back to it. Databases with read-write trans\u2010\nactions do not have this property: if you deploy buggy code that writes bad data\nto the database, then rolling back the code will do nothing to fix the data in the\ndatabase. (The idea of being able to recover from buggy code has been called\nhuman fault tolerance  [50].)\n\u2022As a consequence of this ease of rolling back, feature development can proceed\nmore quickly than in an environment where mistakes could mean irreversible\ndamage. This principle of minimizing irreversibility  is beneficial for Agile soft\u2010\nware development [ 51].\n\u2022If a map or reduce task fails, the MapReduce framework automatically re-\nschedules it and runs it again on the same input. If the failure is due to a bug in\nthe code, it will keep crashing and eventually cause the job to fail after a few\nattempts; but if the failure is due to a transient issue, the fault is tolerated. This\nautomatic retry is only safe because inputs are immutable and outputs from\nfailed tasks are discarded by the MapReduce framework.\n\u2022The same set of files can be used as input for various different jobs, including\nmonitoring jobs that calculate metrics and evaluate whether a job\u2019s output has\nthe expected characteristics (for example, by comparing it to the output from the\nprevious run and measuring discrepancies).\n\u2022Like Unix tools, MapReduce jobs separate logic from wiring (configuring the\ninput and output directories), which provides a separation of concerns and ena\u2010\nbles potential reuse of code: one team can focus on implementing a job that does\none thing well, while other teams can decide where and when to run that job.\nIn these areas, the design principles that worked well for Unix also seem to be work\u2010\ning well for Hadoop\u2014but Unix and Hadoop also differ in some ways.

For example, the Gamma\ndatabase machine, Teradata, and Tandem NonStop SQL were pioneers in this area\n[52].\nThe biggest difference is that MPP databases focus on parallel execution of analytic\nSQL queries on a cluster of machines, while the combination of MapReduce and a\ndistributed filesystem [ 19] provides something much more like a general-purpose\noperating system that can run arbitrary programs.\nDiversity of storage\nDatabases require you to structure data according to a particular model (e.g., rela\u2010\ntional or documents), whereas files in a distributed filesystem are just byte sequences,\nwhich can be written using any data model and encoding.

Simply dumping data in its raw form allows\nfor several such transformations. This approach has been dubbed the sushi principle :\n\u201craw data is better\u201d [ 57].\nThus, Hadoop has often been used for implementing ETL processes (see \u201cData Ware\u2010\nhousing\u201d  on page 91): data from transaction processing systems is dumped into the\ndistributed filesystem in some raw form, and then MapReduce jobs are written to\nclean up that data, transform it into a relational form, and import it into an MPP data\nwarehouse for analytic purposes. Data modeling still happens, but it is in a separate\nstep, decoupled from the data collection. This decoupling is possible because a dis\u2010\ntributed filesystem supports data encoded in any format.\nDiversity of processing models\nMPP databases are monolithic, tightly integrated pieces of software that take care of\nstorage layout on disk, query planning, scheduling, and execution. Since these com\u2010\nponents can all be tuned and optimized for the specific needs of the database, the sys\u2010\ntem as a whole can achieve very good performance on the types of queries for which\nit is designed. Moreover, the SQL query language allows expressive queries and ele\u2010\ngant semantics without the need to write code, making it accessible to graphical tools\nused by business analysts (such as Tableau).\nOn the other hand, not all kinds of processing can be sensibly expressed as SQL quer\u2010\nies. For example, if you are building machine learning and recommendation systems,\nor full-text search indexes with relevance ranking models, or performing image anal\u2010\nysis, you most likely need a more general model of data processing. These kinds of\nprocessing are often very specific to a particular application (e.g., feature engineering\nfor machine learning, natural language models for machine translation, risk estima\u2010\ntion functions for fraud prediction), so they inevitably require writing code, not just\nqueries.\nMapReduce gave engineers the ability to easily run their own code over large data\u2010\nsets.

Is it really worth incurring significant overheads for the sake\nof fault tolerance?\nTo understand the reasons for MapReduce\u2019s sparing use of memory and task-level\nrecovery, it is helpful to look at the environment for which MapReduce was originally\ndesigned. Google has mixed-use datacenters, in which online production services and\noffline batch jobs run on the same machines. Every task has a resource allocation\n(CPU cores, RAM, disk space, etc.) that is enforced using containers. Every task also\nhas a priority, and if a higher-priority task needs more resources, lower-priority tasks\non the same machine can be terminated (preempted) in order to free up resources.\nPriority also determines pricing of the computing resources: teams must pay for the\nresources they use, and higher-priority processes cost more [ 59].\nThis architecture allows non-production (low-priority) computing resources to be\novercommitted, because the system knows that it can reclaim the resources if neces\u2010\nsary. Overcommitting resources in turn allows better utilization of machines and\ngreater efficiency compared to systems that segregate production and non-\nproduction tasks. However, as MapReduce jobs run at low priority, they run the risk\nof being preempted at any time because a higher-priority process requires their\nresources. Batch jobs effectively \u201cpick up the scraps under the table,\u201d using any com\u2010\nputing resources that remain after the high-priority processes have taken what they\nneed.\nAt Google, a MapReduce task that runs for an hour has an approximately 5% risk of\nbeing terminated to make space for a higher-priority process. This rate is more than\nan order of magnitude higher than the rate of failures due to hardware issues,\nmachine reboot, or other reasons [ 59]. At this rate of preemptions, if a job has 100\ntasks that each run for 10 minutes, there is a risk greater than 50% that at least one\ntask will be terminated before it is finished.\nAnd this is why MapReduce is designed to tolerate frequent unexpected task termina\u2010\ntion: it\u2019s not because the hardware is particularly unreliable, it\u2019s because the freedom\nto arbitrarily terminate processes enables better resource utilization in a computing\ncluster.\nAmong open source cluster schedulers, preemption is less widely used. YARN\u2019s\nCapacityScheduler supports preemption for balancing the resource allocation of dif\u2010\nferent queues [ 58], but general priority preemption is not supported in YARN,\nMesos, or Kubernetes at the time of writing [ 60].

That is, simple  in the sense of being able to understand what it is\ndoing, not in the sense of being easy to use. Quite the opposite: implementing a com\u2010\nplex processing job using the raw MapReduce APIs is actually quite hard and labori\u2010\nous\u2014for instance, you would need to implement any join algorithms from scratch\n[37].\nIn response to the difficulty of using MapReduce directly, various higher-level pro\u2010\ngramming models (Pig, Hive, Cascading, Crunch) were created as abstractions on top\nof MapReduce. If you understand how MapReduce works, they are fairly easy to\nlearn, and their higher-level constructs make many common batch processing tasks\nsignificantly easier to implement.\nHowever, there are also problems with the MapReduce execution model itself, which\nare not fixed by adding another level of abstraction and which manifest themselves as\npoor performance for some kinds of processing. On the one hand, MapReduce is\nvery robust: you can use it to process almost arbitrarily large quantities of data on an\nunreliable multi-tenant system with frequent task terminations, and it will still get the\njob done (albeit slowly). On the other hand, other tools are sometimes orders of mag\u2010\nnitude faster for some kinds of processing.\nIn the rest of this chapter, we will look at some of those alternatives for batch process\u2010\ning.

If you want the output of one job to become\nthe input to a second job, you need to configure the second job\u2019s input directory to be\nthe same as the first job\u2019s output directory, and an external workflow scheduler must\nstart the second job only once the first job has completed.\nThis setup is reasonable if the output from the first job is a dataset that you want to\npublish widely within your organization.

Spark and Flink also include their own high-level dataflow APIs,\noften taking inspiration from FlumeJava [ 34].\nThese dataflow APIs generally use relational-style building blocks to express a com\u2010\nputation: joining datasets on the value of some field; grouping tuples by key; filtering\nby some condition; and aggregating tuples by counting, summing, or other functions.\nInternally, these operations are implemented using the various join and grouping\nalgorithms that we discussed earlier in this chapter.\nBesides the obvious advantage of requiring less code, these high-level interfaces also\nallow interactive use, in which you write analysis code incrementally in a shell and\nrun it frequently to observe what it is doing. This style of development is very helpful\nwhen exploring a dataset and experimenting with approaches for processing it. It is\nalso reminiscent of the Unix philosophy, which we discussed in \u201cThe Unix Philoso\u2010\nphy\u201d on page 394 .\nMoreover, these high-level interfaces not only make the humans using the system\nmore productive, but they also improve the job execution efficiency at a machine\nlevel.\nThe move toward declarative query languages\nAn advantage of specifying joins as relational operators, compared to spelling out the\ncode that performs the join, is that the framework can analyze the properties of the\njoin inputs and automatically decide which of the aforementioned join algorithms\nwould be most suitable for the task at hand. Hive, Spark, and Flink have cost-based\nquery optimizers that can do this, and even change the order of joins so that the\namount of intermediate state is minimized [ 66, 77, 78, 79].\nThe choice of join algorithm can make a big difference to the performance of a batch\njob, and it is nice not to have to understand and remember all the various join algo\u2010\nrithms we discussed in this chapter. This is possible if joins are specified in a declara\u2010\ntive way: the application simply states which joins are required, and the query\noptimizer decides how they can best be executed. We previously came across this idea\nin \u201cQuery Languages for Data\u201d on page 42 .\nHowever, in other ways, MapReduce and its dataflow successors are very different\nfrom the fully declarative query model of SQL. MapReduce was built around the idea\nof function callbacks: for each record or group of records, a user-defined function\n(the mapper or reducer) is called, and that function is free to call arbitrary code in\norder to decide what to output. This approach has the advantage that you can draw\nBeyond MapReduce | 427",

For example, if a callback func\u2010\ntion contains only a simple filtering condition, or it just selects some fields from a\nrecord, then there is significant CPU overhead in calling the function on every\nrecord. If such simple filtering and mapping operations are expressed in a declarative\nway, the query optimizer can take advantage of column-oriented storage layouts (see\n\u201cColumn-Oriented Storage\u201d on page 95) and read only the required columns from\ndisk.

We started by looking at\nUnix tools such as awk, grep , and sort , and we saw how the design philosophy of\nthose tools is carried forward into MapReduce and more recent dataflow engines.\nSome of those design principles are that inputs are immutable, outputs are intended\nto become the input to another (as yet unknown) program, and complex problems\nare solved by composing small tools that \u201cdo one thing well.\u201d\nIn the Unix world, the uniform interface that allows one program to be composed\nwith another is files and pipes; in MapReduce, that interface is a distributed filesys\u2010\ntem. We saw that dataflow engines add their own pipe-like data transport mecha\u2010\nnisms to avoid materializing intermediate state to the distributed filesystem, but the\ninitial input and final output of a job is still usually HDFS.\nThe two main problems that distributed batch processing frameworks need to solve\nare:\nPartitioning\nIn MapReduce, mappers are partitioned according to input file blocks. The out\u2010\nput of mappers is repartitioned, sorted, and merged into a configurable number\nof reducer partitions. The purpose of this process is to bring all the related data\u2014\ne.g., all the records with the same key\u2014together in the same place.\nPost-MapReduce dataflow engines try to avoid sorting unless it is required, but\nthey otherwise take a broadly similar approach to partitioning.\nFault tolerance\nMapReduce frequently writes to disk, which makes it easy to recover from an\nindividual failed task without restarting the entire job but slows down execution\nin the failure-free case. Dataflow engines perform less materialization of inter\u2010\nmediate state and keep more in memory, which means that they need to recom\u2010\npute more data if a node fails. Deterministic operators reduce the amount of data\nthat needs to be recomputed.\nSummary | 429",

They also provide a good illustra\u2010\ntion of how partitioned algorithms work:\nSort-merge joins\nEach of the inputs being joined goes through a mapper that extracts the join key.\nBy partitioning, sorting, and merging, all the records with the same key end up\ngoing to the same call of the reducer. This function can then output the joined\nrecords.\nBroadcast hash joins\nOne of the two join inputs is small, so it is not partitioned and it can be entirely\nloaded into a hash table. Thus, you can start a mapper for each partition of the\nlarge join input, load the hash table for the small input into each mapper, and\nthen scan over the large input one record at a time, querying the hash table for\neach record.\nPartitioned hash joins\nIf the two join inputs are partitioned in the same way (using the same key, same\nhash function, and same number of partitions), then the hash table approach can\nbe used independently for each partition.\nDistributed batch processing engines have a deliberately restricted programming\nmodel: callback functions (such as mappers and reducers) are assumed to be stateless\nand to have no externally visible side effects besides their designated output. This\nrestriction allows the framework to hide some of the hard distributed systems prob\u2010\nlems behind its abstraction: in the face of crashes and network issues, tasks can be\nretried safely, and the output from any failed tasks is discarded. If several tasks for a\npartition succeed, only one of them actually makes its output visible.\nThanks to the framework, your code in a batch processing job does not need to worry\nabout implementing fault-tolerance mechanisms: the framework can guarantee that\nthe final output of a job is the same as if no faults had occurred, even though in real\u2010\nity various tasks perhaps had to be retried. These reliable semantics are much stron\u2010\nger than what you usually have in online services that handle user requests and that\nwrite to databases as a side effect of processing a request.\nThe distinguishing feature of a batch processing job is that it reads some input data\nand produces some output data, without modifying the input\u2014in other words, the\noutput is derived from the input. Crucially, the input data is bounded : it has a known,\nfixed size (for example, it consists of a set of log files at some point in time, or a snap\u2010\nshot of a database\u2019s contents). Because it is bounded, a job knows when it has finished\nreading the entire input, and so a job eventually completes when it is done.\nIn the next chapter, we will turn to stream processing, in which the input is unboun\u2010\nded\u2014that is, you still have a job, but its inputs are never-ending streams of data.

The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from\nscratch never works and cannot be made to work.\n\u2014John Gall, Systemantics  (1975)\nIn Chapter 10  we discussed batch processing\u2014techniques that read a set of files as\ninput and produce a new set of output files. The output is a form of derived data ; that\nis, a dataset that can be recreated by running the batch process again if necessary. We\nsaw how this simple but powerful idea can be used to create search indexes, recom\u2010\nmendation systems, analytics, and more.\nHowever, one big assumption remained throughout Chapter 10 : namely, that the\ninput is bounded\u2014i.e., of a known and finite size\u2014so the batch process knows when\nit has finished reading its input. For example, the sorting operation that is central to\nMapReduce must read its entire input before it can start producing output: it could\nhappen that the very last input record is the one with the lowest key, and thus needs\nto be the very first output record, so starting the output early is not an option.\nIn reality, a lot of data is unbounded because it arrives gradually over time: your users\nproduced data yesterday and today, and they will continue to produce more data\ntomorrow. Unless you go out of business, this process never ends, and so the dataset\nis never \u201ccomplete\u201d in any meaningful way [ 1]. Thus, batch processors must artifi\u2010\ncially divide the data into chunks of fixed duration: for example, processing a day\u2019s\nworth of data at the end of every day, or processing an hour\u2019s worth of data at the end\nof every hour.\nThe problem with daily batch processes is that changes in the input are only reflected\nin the output a day later, which is too slow for many impatient users. To reduce the\ndelay, we can run the processing more frequently\u2014say, processing a second\u2019s worth\nof data at the end of every second\u2014or even continuously, abandoning the fixed time\n439",

That is the idea\nbehind stream processing .\nIn general, a \u201cstream\u201d refers to data that is incrementally made available over time.\nThe concept appears in many places: in the stdin  and stdout  of Unix, programming\nlanguages (lazy lists) [ 2], filesystem APIs (such as Java\u2019s FileInputStream ), TCP con\u2010\nnections, delivering audio and video over the internet, and so on.\nIn this chapter we will look at event streams  as a data management mechanism: the\nunbounded, incrementally processed counterpart to the batch data we saw in the\nlast chapter. We will first discuss how streams are represented, stored, and transmit\u2010\nted over a network. In \u201cDatabases and Streams\u201d on page 451 we will investigate\nthe relationship between streams and databases. And finally, in \u201cProcessing Streams\u201d\non page 464 we will explore approaches and tools for processing those streams\ncontinually, and ways that they can be used to build applications.\nTransmitting Event Streams\nIn the batch processing world, the inputs and outputs of a job are files (perhaps on a\ndistributed filesystem). What does the streaming equivalent look like?\nWhen the input is a file (a sequence of bytes), the first processing step is usually to\nparse it into a sequence of records. In a stream processing context, a record is more\ncommonly known as an event , but it is essentially the same thing: a small, self-\ncontained, immutable object containing the details of something that happened at\nsome point in time. An event usually contains a timestamp indicating when it hap\u2010\npened according to a time-of-day clock (see \u201cMonotonic Versus Time-of-Day\nClocks\u201d on page 288 ).\nFor example, the thing that happened might be an action that a user took, such as\nviewing a page or making a purchase. It might also originate from a machine, such as\na periodic measurement from a temperature sensor, or a CPU utilization metric. In\nthe example of \u201cBatch Processing with Unix Tools\u201d  on page 391, each line of the web\nserver log is an event.\nAn event may be encoded as a text string, or JSON, or perhaps in some binary form,\nas discussed in Chapter 4 . This encoding allows you to store an event, for example by\nappending it to a file, inserting it into a relational table, or writing it to a document\ndatabase. It also allows you to send the event over the network to another node in\norder to process it.\nIn batch processing, a file is written once and then potentially read by multiple jobs.\nAnalogously, in streaming terminology, an event is generated once by a producer\n(also known as a publisher  or sender ), and then potentially processed by multiple con\u2010\nsumers  (subscribers  or recipients ) [3].

Batch processing relies on reprocessing entire datasets, while streams represent a continuously flowing, incremental approach.  From a reliability standpoint, the producer/consumer model is crucial \u2013 ensuring that even if a consumer fails, the producer can continue to generate events, and a system needs to be designed to handle potential backpressure or event loss.

    "chunk": "related records; in a streaming system, related events are usually grouped together\ninto a topic  or stream .\nIn principle, a file or database is sufficient to connect producers and consumers: a\nproducer writes every event that it generates to the datastore, and each consumer\nperiodically polls the datastore to check for events that have appeared since it last ran.\nThis is essentially what a batch process does when it processes a day\u2019s worth of data at\nthe end of every day.\nHowever, when moving toward continual processing with low delays, polling\nbecomes expensive if the datastore is not designed for this kind of usage. The more\noften you poll, the lower the percentage of requests that return new events, and thus\nthe higher the overheads become. Instead, it is better for consumers to be notified\nwhen new events appear.\nDatabases have traditionally not supported this kind of notification mechanism very\nwell: relational databases commonly have triggers , which can react to a change (e.g., a\nrow being inserted into a table), but they are very limited in what they can do and\nhave been somewhat of an afterthought in database design [ 4, 5]. Instead, specialized\ntools have been developed for the purpose of delivering event notifications.\nMessaging Systems\nA common approach for notifying consumers about new events is to use a messaging\nsystem : a producer sends a message containing the event, which is then pushed to\nconsumers. We touched on these systems previously in \u201cMessage-Passing Dataflow\u201d\non page 136 , but we will now go into more detail.\nA direct communication channel like a Unix pipe or TCP connection between pro\u2010\nducer and consumer would be a simple way of implementing a messaging system.\nHowever, most messaging systems expand on this basic model. In particular, Unix\npipes and TCP connect exactly one sender with one recipient, whereas a messaging\nsystem allows multiple producer nodes to send messages to the same topic and allows\nmultiple consumer nodes to receive messages in a topic.\nWithin this publish/subscribe  model, different systems take a wide range of\napproaches, and there is no one right answer for all purposes. To differentiate the\nsystems, it is particularly helpful to ask the following two questions:\n1.What happens if the producers send messages faster than the consumers can pro\u2010\ncess them?  Broadly speaking, there are three options: the system can drop mes\u2010\nsages, buffer messages in a queue, or apply backpressure  (also known as flow\ncontrol ; i.e., blocking the producer from sending more messages).

Does the system crash if the queue no longer fits in mem\u2010\nory, or does it write messages to disk? If so, how does the disk access affect the\nperformance of the messaging system [ 6]?\n2.What happens if nodes crash or temporarily go offline\u2014are any messages lost?  As\nwith databases, durability may require some combination of writing to disk\nand/or replication (see the sidebar \u201cReplication and Durability\u201d on page 227),\nwhich has a cost. If you can afford to sometimes lose messages, you can probably\nget higher throughput and lower latency on the same hardware.\nWhether message loss is acceptable depends very much on the application. For exam\u2010\nple, with sensor readings and metrics that are transmitted periodically, an occasional\nmissing data point is perhaps not important, since an updated value will be sent a\nshort time later anyway. However, beware that if a large number of messages are\ndropped, it may not be immediately apparent that the metrics are incorrect [ 7]. If you\nare counting events, it is more important that they are delivered reliably, since every\nlost message means incorrect counters.\nA nice property of the batch processing systems we explored in Chapter 10  is that\nthey provide a strong reliability guarantee: failed tasks are automatically retried, and\npartial output from failed tasks is automatically discarded. This means the output is\nthe same as if no failures had occurred, which helps simplify the programming\nmodel. Later in this chapter we will examine how we can provide similar guarantees\nin a streaming context.\nDirect messaging from producers to consumers\nA number of messaging systems use direct network communication between produc\u2010\ners and consumers without going via intermediary nodes:\n\u2022UDP multicast is widely used in the financial industry for streams such as stock\nmarket feeds, where low latency is important [ 8]. Although UDP itself is unrelia\u2010\nble, application-level protocols can recover lost packets (the producer must\nremember packets it has sent so that it can retransmit them on demand).\n\u2022Brokerless messaging libraries such as ZeroMQ [ 9] and nanomsg take a similar\napproach, implementing publish/subscribe messaging over TCP or IP multicast.\n\u2022StatsD [ 10] and Brubeck [ 7] use unreliable UDP messaging for collecting metrics\nfrom all machines on the network and monitoring them. (In the StatsD protocol,\ncounter metrics are only correct if all messages are received; using UDP makes\nthe metrics at best approximate [ 11].

The key takeaway is that if we accept some degree of message loss, we can often achieve significantly higher throughput, but we must acknowledge the impact on data accuracy, particularly for counters.

    "chunk": "\u2022If the consumer exposes a service on the network, producers can make a direct\nHTTP or RPC request (see \u201cDataflow Through Services: REST and RPC\u201d on page\n131) to push messages to the consumer. This is the idea behind webhooks [ 12], a\npattern in which a callback URL of one service is registered with another service,\nand it makes a request to that URL whenever an event occurs.\nAlthough these direct messaging systems work well in the situations for which they\nare designed, they generally require the application code to be aware of the possibility\nof message loss. The faults they can tolerate are quite limited: even if the protocols\ndetect and retransmit packets that are lost in the network, they generally assume that\nproducers and consumers are constantly online.\nIf a consumer is offline, it may miss messages that were sent while it is unreachable.\nSome protocols allow the producer to retry failed message deliveries, but this\napproach may break down if the producer crashes, losing the buffer of messages that\nit was supposed to retry.\nMessage brokers\nA widely used alternative is to send messages via a message broker  (also known as a\nmessage queue ), which is essentially a kind of database that is optimized for handling\nmessage streams [ 13]. It runs as a server, with producers and consumers connecting\nto it as clients. Producers write messages to the broker, and consumers receive them\nby reading them from the broker.\nBy centralizing the data in the broker, these systems can more easily tolerate clients\nthat come and go (connect, disconnect, and crash), and the question of durability is\nmoved to the broker instead.

Contrast this with files and databases, where you can add a\nnew client at any time, and it can read data written arbitrarily far in the past (as long\nas it has not been explicitly overwritten or deleted by the application).\nWhy can we not have a hybrid, combining the durable storage approach of databases\nwith the low-latency notification facilities of messaging?

If a consumer reaches the end of the log, it waits for a\nnotification that a new message has been appended. The Unix tool tail -f , which\nwatches a file for data being appended, essentially works like this.\nIn order to scale to higher throughput than a single disk can offer, the log can be\npartitioned  (in the sense of Chapter 6 ). Different partitions can then be hosted on dif\u2010\nferent machines, making each partition a separate log that can be read and written\nindependently from other partitions.

For this reason it was difficult to take all the changes\nmade in a database and replicate them to a different storage technology such as a\nsearch index, cache, or data warehouse.\nMore recently, there has been growing interest in change data capture  (CDC), which\nis the process of observing all data changes written to a database and extracting them\nin a form in which they can be replicated to other systems.

    "chunk": "Log compaction\nIf you can only keep a limited amount of log history, you need to go through the\nsnapshot process every time you want to add a new derived data system. However,\nlog compaction  provides a good alternative.\nWe discussed log compaction previously in \u201cHash Indexes\u201d  on page 72, in the con\u2010\ntext of log-structured storage engines (see Figure 3-2  for an example). The principle\nis simple: the storage engine periodically looks for log records with the same key,\nthrows away any duplicates, and keeps only the most recent update for each key. This\ncompaction and merging process runs in the background.\nIn a log-structured storage engine, an update with a special null value (a tombstone )\nindicates that a key was deleted, and causes it to be removed during log compaction.\nBut as long as a key is not overwritten or deleted, it stays in the log forever. The disk\nspace required for such a compacted log depends only on the current contents of the\ndatabase, not the number of writes that have ever occurred in the database. If the\nsame key is frequently overwritten, previous values will eventually be garbage-\ncollected, and only the latest value will be retained.\nThe same idea works in the context of log-based message brokers and change data\ncapture. If the CDC system is set up such that every change has a primary key, and\nevery update for a key replaces the previous value for that key, then it\u2019s sufficient to\nkeep just the most recent write for a particular key.\nNow, whenever you want to rebuild a derived data system such as a search index, you\ncan start a new consumer from offset 0 of the log-compacted topic, and sequentially\nscan over all messages in the log. The log is guaranteed to contain the most recent\nvalue for every key in the database (and maybe some older values)\u2014in other words,\nyou can use it to obtain a full copy of the database contents without having to take\nanother snapshot of the CDC source database.\nThis log compaction feature is supported by Apache Kafka. As we shall see later in\nthis chapter, it allows the message broker to be used for durable storage, not just for\ntransient messaging.\nAPI support for change streams\nIncreasingly, databases are beginning to support change streams as a first-class inter\u2010\nface, rather than the typical retrofitted and reverse-engineered CDC efforts. For\nexample, RethinkDB allows queries to subscribe to notifications when the results of a\nquery change [ 36], Firebase [ 37] and CouchDB [ 38] provide data synchronization\nbased on a change feed that is also made available to applications, and Meteor uses\nthe MongoDB oplog to subscribe to data changes and update the user interface [ 39].\nVoltDB allows transactions to continuously export data from a database in the form\nof a stream [ 40].

Once the stream of change events is in Kafka, it\ncan be used to update derived data systems such as search indexes, and also feed into\nstream processing systems as discussed later in this chapter. \nEvent Sourcing\nThere are some parallels between the ideas we\u2019ve discussed here and event sourcing , a\ntechnique that was developed in the domain-driven design (DDD) community [ 42,\n43, 44]. We will discuss event sourcing briefly, because it incorporates some useful\nand relevant ideas for streaming systems.\nSimilarly to change data capture, event sourcing involves storing all changes to the\napplication state as a log of change events. The biggest difference is that event sourc\u2010\ning applies the idea at a different level of abstraction:\n\u2022In change data capture, the application uses the database in a mutable way,\nupdating and deleting records at will. The log of changes is extracted from the\ndatabase at a low level (e.g., by parsing the replication log), which ensures that\nthe order of writes extracted from the database matches the order in which they\nwere actually written, avoiding the race condition in Figure 11-4 . The application\nwriting to the database does not need to be aware that CDC is occurring.\n\u2022In event sourcing, the application logic is explicitly built on the basis of immuta\u2010\nble events that are written to an event log. In this case, the event store is append-\nonly, and updates or deletes are discouraged or prohibited. Events are designed\nto reflect things that happened at the application level, rather than low-level state\nchanges.\nEvent sourcing is a powerful technique for data modeling: from an application point\nof view it is more meaningful to record the user\u2019s actions as immutable events, rather\nthan recording the effect of those actions on a mutable database. Event sourcing\nmakes it easier to evolve applications over time, helps with debugging by making it\neasier to understand after the fact why something happened, and guards against\napplication bugs (see \u201cAdvantages of immutable events\u201d on page 460 ).\nFor example, storing the event \u201cstudent cancelled their course enrollment\u201d clearly\nexpresses the intent of a single action in a neutral fashion, whereas the side effects\n\u201cone entry was deleted from the enrollments table, and one cancellation reason was\nadded to the student feedback table\u201d embed a lot of assumptions about the way the\nDatabases and Streams | 457",

A conventional database or a log-based message broker can also be used\nto build applications in this style.\nDeriving current state from the event log\nAn event log by itself is not very useful, because users generally expect to see the cur\u2010\nrent state of a system, not the history of modifications. For example, on a shopping\nwebsite, users expect to be able to see the current contents of their cart, not an\nappend-only list of all the changes they have ever made to their cart.\nThus, applications that use event sourcing need to take the log of events (representing\nthe data written  to the system) and transform it into application state that is suitable\nfor showing to a user (the way in which data is read  from the system [ 47]). This\ntransformation can use arbitrary logic, but it should be deterministic so that you can\nrun it again and derive the same application state from the event log.\nLike with change data capture, replaying the event log allows you to reconstruct the\ncurrent state of the system. However, log compaction needs to be handled differently:\n\u2022A CDC event for the update of a record typically contains the entire new version\nof the record, so the current value for a primary key is entirely determined by the\nmost recent event for that primary key, and log compaction can discard previous\nevents for the same key.\n\u2022On the other hand, with event sourcing, events are modeled at a higher level: an\nevent typically expresses the intent of a user action, not the mechanics of the state\nupdate that occurred as a result of the action. In this case, later events typically\ndo not override prior events, and so you need the full history of events to recon\u2010\nstruct the final state. Log compaction is not possible in the same way.\nApplications that use event sourcing typically have some mechanism for storing\nsnapshots of the current state that is derived from the log of events, so they don\u2019t\nneed to repeatedly reprocess the full log. However, this is only a performance optimi\u2010\nzation to speed up reads and recovery from crashes; the intention is that the system is\nable to store all raw events forever and reprocess the full event log whenever required.\nWe discuss this assumption in \u201cLimitations of immutability\u201d on page 463 . \n458 | Chapter 11: Stream Processing",

When a request from a user first arrives, it is initially a command: at this\npoint it may still fail, for example because some integrity condition is violated. The\napplication must first validate that it can execute the command. If the validation is\nsuccessful and the command is accepted, it becomes an event, which is durable and\nimmutable.\nFor example, if a user tries to register a particular username, or reserve a seat on an\nairplane or in a theater, then the application needs to check that the username or seat\nis not already taken. (We previously discussed this example in \u201cFault-Tolerant Con\u2010\nsensus\u201d  on page 364.) When that check has succeeded, the application can generate\nan event to indicate that a particular username was registered by a particular user ID,\nor that a particular seat has been reserved for a particular customer.\nAt the point when the event is generated, it becomes a fact. Even if the customer later\ndecides to change or cancel the reservation, the fact remains true that they formerly\nheld a reservation for a particular seat, and the change or cancellation is a separate\nevent that is added later.\nA consumer of the event stream is not allowed to reject an event: by the time the con\u2010\nsumer sees the event, it is already an immutable part of the log, and it may have\nalready been seen by other consumers. Thus, any validation of a command needs to\nhappen synchronously, before it becomes an event\u2014for example, by using a serializa\u2010\nble transaction that atomically validates the command and publishes the event.\nAlternatively, the user request to reserve a seat could be split into two events: first a\ntentative reservation, and then a separate confirmation event once the reservation has\nbeen validated (as discussed in \u201cImplementing linearizable storage using total order\nbroadcast\u201d on page 350). This split allows the validation to take place in an asynchro\u2010\nnous process. \nState, Streams, and Immutability\nWe saw in Chapter 10  that batch processing benefits from the immutability of its\ninput files, so you can run experimental processing jobs on existing input files\nwithout fear of damaging them. This principle of immutability is also what makes\nevent sourcing and change data capture so powerful.\nWe normally think of databases as storing the current state of the application\u2014this\nrepresentation is optimized for reads, and it is usually the most convenient for serv\u2010\ning queries.

As Pat Helland puts it [ 52]:\nTransaction logs record all the changes made to the database. High-speed appends are\nthe only way to change the log. From this perspective, the contents of the database\nhold a caching of the latest record values in the logs. The truth is the log. The database\nis a cache of a subset of the log. That cached subset happens to be the latest value of\neach record and index value from the log.\nLog compaction, as discussed in \u201cLog compaction\u201d on page 456, is one way of bridg\u2010\ning the distinction between log and database state: it retains only the latest version of\neach record, and discards overwritten versions.\nAdvantages of immutable events\nImmutability in databases is an old idea.

The incorrect transaction still remains in\nthe ledger forever, because it might be important for auditing reasons.

This process is entirely nor\u2010\nmal in accounting [ 54].\nAlthough such auditability is particularly important in financial systems, it is also\nbeneficial for many other systems that are not subject to such strict regulation. As\ndiscussed in \u201cPhilosophy of batch process outputs\u201d on page 413, if you accidentally\ndeploy buggy code that writes bad data to a database, recovery is much harder if the\ncode is able to destructively overwrite data. With an append-only log of immutable\nevents, it is much easier to diagnose what happened and recover from the problem.\nImmutable events also capture more information than just the current state. For\nexample, on a shopping website, a customer may add an item to their cart and then\nremove it again. Although the second event cancels out the first event from the point\nof view of order fulfillment, it may be useful to know for analytics purposes that the\ncustomer was considering a particular item but then decided against it.

Running old and new systems side by side is\noften easier than performing a complicated schema migration in an existing system.\nOnce the old system is no longer needed, you can simply shut it down and reclaim its\nresources [ 47, 57].\nStoring data is normally quite straightforward if you don\u2019t have to worry about how it\nis going to be queried and accessed; many of the complexities of schema design,\nindexing, and storage engines are the result of wanting to support certain query and\naccess patterns (see Chapter 3 ). For this reason, you gain a lot of flexibility by sepa\u2010\nrating the form in which data is written from the form it is read, and by allowing sev\u2010\neral different read views. This idea is sometimes known as command query\nresponsibility segregation  (CQRS) [ 42, 58, 59].\nThe traditional approach to database and schema design is based on the fallacy that\ndata must be written in the same form as it will be queried. Debates about normaliza\u2010\ntion and denormalization (see \u201cMany-to-One and Many-to-Many Relationships\u201d  on\npage 33) become largely irrelevant if you can translate data from a write-optimized\nevent log to read-optimized application state: it is entirely reasonable to denormalize\ndata in the read-optimized views, as the translation process gives you a mechanism\nfor keeping it consistent with the event log.\nIn \u201cDescribing Load\u201d on page 11 we discussed Twitter\u2019s home timelines, a cache of\nrecently written tweets by the people a particular user is following (like a mailbox).\nThis is another example of read-optimized state: home timelines are highly denor\u2010\nmalized, since your tweets are duplicated in all of the timelines of the people follow\u2010\ning you. However, the fan-out service keeps this duplicated state in sync with new\ntweets and new following relationships, which keeps the duplication manageable.\nConcurrency control\nThe biggest downside of event sourcing and change data capture is that the consum\u2010\ners of the event log are usually asynchronous, so there is a possibility that a user may\nmake a write to the log, then read from a log-derived view and find that their write\nhas not yet been reflected in the read view. We discussed this problem and potential\nsolutions previously in \u201cReading Your Own Writes\u201d on page 162 .\nOne solution would be to perform the updates of the read view synchronously with\nappending the event to the log. This requires a transaction to combine the writes into\nan atomic unit, so either you need to keep the event log and the read view in the same\nstorage system, or you need a distributed transaction across the different systems.\nAlternatively, you could use the approach discussed in \u201cImplementing linearizable\nstorage using total order broadcast\u201d on page 350 .\nOn the other hand, deriving the current state from an event log also simplifies some\naspects of concurrency control.

The\nanswer depends on the amount of churn in the dataset. Some workloads mostly add\ndata and rarely update or delete; they are easy to make immutable. Other workloads\nhave a high rate of updates and deletes on a comparatively small dataset; in these\ncases, the immutable history may grow prohibitively large, fragmentation may\nbecome an issue, and the performance of compaction and garbage collection\nbecomes crucial for operational robustness [ 60, 61].\nBesides the performance reasons, there may also be circumstances in which you need\ndata to be deleted for administrative reasons, in spite of all immutability.

Broadly, there are three options:\n1.You can take the data in the events and write it to a database, cache, search index,\nor similar storage system, from where it can then be queried by other clients. As\nshown in Figure 11-5 , this is a good way of keeping a database in sync with\nchanges happening in other parts of the system\u2014especially if the stream con\u2010\nsumer is the only client writing to the database.

In this case, a human is the ultimate consumer of the\nstream.\n3.You can process one or more input streams to produce one or more output\nstreams. Streams may go through a pipeline consisting of several such processing\nstages before they eventually end up at an output (option 1 or 2).\nIn the rest of this chapter, we will discuss option 3: processing streams to produce\nother, derived streams. A piece of code that processes streams like this is known as an\noperator  or a job. It is closely related to the Unix processes and MapReduce jobs we\ndiscussed in Chapter 10 , and the pattern of dataflow is similar: a stream processor\nconsumes input streams in a read-only fashion and writes its output to a different\nlocation in an append-only fashion.\nThe patterns for partitioning and parallelization in stream processors are also very\nsimilar to those in MapReduce and the dataflow engines we saw in Chapter 10 , so we\nwon\u2019t repeat those topics here. Basic mapping operations such as transforming and\nfiltering records also work the same.\nThe one crucial difference to batch jobs is that a stream never ends.

For example:\n\u2022Fraud detection systems need to determine if the usage patterns of a credit card\nhave unexpectedly changed, and block the card if it is likely to have been stolen.\n\u2022Trading systems need to examine price changes in a financial market and execute\ntrades according to specified rules.\n\u2022Manufacturing systems need to monitor the status of machines in a factory, and\nquickly identify the problem if there is a malfunction.\n\u2022Military and intelligence systems need to track the activities of a potential aggres\u2010\nsor, and raise the alarm if there are signs of an attack.\nThese kinds of applications require quite sophisticated pattern matching and correla\u2010\ntions. However, other uses of stream processing have also emerged over time. In this\nsection we will briefly compare and contrast some of these applications.\nComplex event processing\nComplex event processing  (CEP) is an approach developed in the 1990s for analyzing\nevent streams, especially geared toward the kind of application that requires search\u2010\ning for certain event patterns [ 65, 66]. Similarly to the way that a regular expression\nallows you to search for certain patterns of characters in a string, CEP allows you to\nspecify rules to search for certain patterns of events in a stream.\nCEP systems often use a high-level declarative query language like SQL, or a graphi\u2010\ncal user interface, to describe the patterns of events that should be detected. These\nqueries are submitted to a processing engine that consumes the input streams and\ninternally maintains a state machine that performs the required matching. When a\nmatch is found, the engine emits a complex event  (hence the name) with the details of\nthe event pattern that was detected [ 67].\nIn these systems, the relationship between queries and data is reversed compared to\nnormal databases. Usually, a database stores data persistently and treats queries as\ntransient: when a query comes in, the database searches for data matching the query,\nand then forgets about the query when it has finished. CEP engines reverse these\nroles: queries are stored long-term, and events from the input streams continuously\nflow past them in search of a query that matches an event pattern [ 68].\nProcessing Streams | 465",

We can regard these examples as\nspecific cases of maintaining materialized views  (see \u201cAggregation: Data Cubes and\nMaterialized Views\u201d on page 101): deriving an alternative view onto some dataset so\nthat you can query it efficiently, and updating that view whenever the underlying\ndata changes [ 50].\nSimilarly, in event sourcing, application state is maintained by applying a log of\nevents; here the application state is also a kind of materialized view. Unlike stream\nanalytics scenarios, it is usually not sufficient to consider only events within some\ntime window: building the materialized view potentially requires all events over an\narbitrary time period, apart from any obsolete events that may be discarded by log\ncompaction (see \u201cLog compaction\u201d on page 456).

This is done by formulating a search query in advance,\nand then continually matching the stream of news items against this query. Similar\nfeatures exist on some websites: for example, users of real estate websites can ask to\nbe notified when a new property matching their search criteria appears on the mar\u2010\nket. The percolator feature of Elasticsearch [ 76] is one option for implementing this\nkind of stream search.\nConventional search engines first index the documents and then run queries over the\nindex.

Although these systems are also based on messages and\nevents, we normally don\u2019t think of them as stream processors:\n\u2022Actor frameworks are primarily a mechanism for managing concurrency and\ndistributed execution of communicating modules, whereas stream processing is\nprimarily a data management technique.\n\u2022Communication between actors is often ephemeral and one-to-one, whereas\nevent logs are durable and multi-subscriber.\n\u2022Actors can communicate in arbitrary ways (including cyclic request/response\npatterns), but stream processors are usually set up in acyclic pipelines where\nevery stream is the output of one particular job, and derived from a well-defined\nset of input streams.\nThat said, there is some crossover area between RPC-like systems and stream pro\u2010\ncessing. For example, Apache Storm has a feature called distributed RPC , which\nallows user queries to be farmed out to a set of nodes that also process event streams;\nthese queries are then interleaved with events from the input streams, and results can\nbe aggregated and sent back to the user [ 78]. (See also \u201cMulti-partition data process\u2010\ning\u201d on page 514 .)\nIt is also possible to process streams using actor frameworks. However, many such\nframeworks do not guarantee message delivery in the case of crashes, so the process\u2010\ning is not fault-tolerant unless you implement additional retry logic.\nReasoning About Time\nStream processors often need to deal with time, especially when used for analytics\npurposes, which frequently use time windows such as \u201cthe average over the last five\nminutes.\u201d It might seem that the meaning of \u201cthe last five minutes\u201d should be unam\u2010\nbiguous and clear, but unfortunately the notion is surprisingly tricky.\nIn a batch process, the processing tasks rapidly crunch through a large collection of\nhistorical events. If some kind of breakdown by time needs to happen, the batch pro\u2010\ncess needs to look at the timestamp embedded in each event. There is no point in\nlooking at the system clock of the machine running the batch process, because the\ntime at which the process is run has nothing to do with the time at which the events\nactually occurred.\nA batch process may read a year\u2019s worth of historical events within a few minutes; in\nmost cases, the timeline of interest is the year of history, not the few minutes of pro\u2010\ncessing.

Thank you to Kostas Kloudas from the Flink community for coming up with this analogy.deterministic: running the same process again on the same input yields the same\nresult (see \u201cFault tolerance\u201d on page 422 ).\nOn the other hand, many stream processing frameworks use the local system clock\non the processing machine (the processing time ) to determine windowing [ 79]. This\napproach has the advantage of being simple, and it is reasonable if the delay between\nevent creation and event processing is negligibly short. However, it breaks down if\nthere is any significant processing lag\u2014i.e., if the processing may happen noticeably\nlater than the time at which the event actually occurred.\nEvent time versus processing time\nThere are many reasons why processing may be delayed: queueing, network faults\n(see \u201cUnreliable Networks\u201d on page 277), a performance issue leading to contention\nin the message broker or processor, a restart of the stream consumer, or reprocessing\nof past events (see \u201cReplaying old messages\u201d on page 451) while recovering from a\nfault or after fixing a bug in the code.\nMoreover, message delays can also lead to unpredictable ordering of messages. For\nexample, say a user first makes one web request (which is handled by web server A),\nand then a second request (which is handled by server B). A and B emit events\ndescribing the requests they handled, but B\u2019s event reaches the message broker before\nA\u2019s event does. Now stream processors will first see the B event and then the A event,\neven though they actually occurred in the opposite order.\nIf it helps to have an analogy, consider the Star Wars  movies: Episode IV was released\nin 1977, Episode V in 1980, and Episode VI in 1983, followed by Episodes I, II, and\nIII in 1999, 2002, and 2005, respectively, and Episode VII in 2015 [ 80].ii If you\nwatched the movies in the order they came out, the order in which you processed the\nmovies is inconsistent with the order of their narrative. (The episode number is like\nthe event timestamp, and the date when you watched the movie is the processing\ntime.) As humans, we are able to cope with such discontinuities, but stream process\u2010\ning algorithms need to be specifically written to accommodate such timing and\nordering issues.\nConfusing event time and processing time leads to bad data. For example, say you\nhave a stream processor that measures the rate of requests (counting the number of\nrequests per second). If you redeploy the stream processor, it may be shut down for a\nminute and process the backlog of events when it comes back up. If you measure the\nrate based on the processing time, it will look as if there was a sudden anomalous\nspike of requests while processing the backlog, when in fact the real rate of requests\nwas steady ( Figure 11-7 ).\nProcessing Streams | 469",

For example, consider a mobile app that reports events\nfor usage metrics to a server. The app may be used while the device is offline, in\nwhich case it will buffer events locally on the device and send them to a server when\nan internet connection is next available (which may be hours or even days later). To\nany consumers of this stream, the events will appear as extremely delayed stragglers.\nIn this context, the timestamp on the events should really be the time at which the\nuser interaction occurred, according to the mobile device\u2019s local clock.

The window can then\nbe used for aggregations, for example to count events, or to calculate the average of\nvalues within the window. Several types of windows are in common use [ 79, 83]:\nTumbling window\nA tumbling window has a fixed length, and every event belongs to exactly one\nwindow. For example, if you have a 1-minute tumbling window, all the events\nwith timestamps between 10:03:00 and 10:03:59 are grouped into one window,\nevents between 10:04:00 and 10:04:59 into the next window, and so on. You\ncould implement a 1-minute tumbling window by taking each event timestamp\nand rounding it down to the nearest minute to determine the window that it\nbelongs to.\nHopping window\nA hopping window also has a fixed length, but allows windows to overlap in\norder to provide some smoothing. For example, a 5-minute window with a hop\nsize of 1 minute would contain the events between 10:03:00 and 10:07:59, then\nthe next window would cover events between 10:04:00 and 10:08:59, and so on.\nYou can implement this hopping window by first calculating 1-minute tumbling\nwindows, and then aggregating over several adjacent windows.\nSliding window\nA sliding window contains all the events that occur within some interval of each\nother. For example, a 5-minute sliding window would cover events at 10:03:39\nand 10:08:12, because they are less than 5 minutes apart (note that tumbling and\nhopping 5-minute windows would not have put these two events in the same\nwindow, as they use fixed boundaries). A sliding window can be implemented by\nkeeping a buffer of events sorted by time and removing old events when they\nexpire from the window.\nSession window\nUnlike the other window types, a session window has no fixed duration. Instead,\nit is defined by grouping together all events for the same user that occur closely\ntogether in time, and the window ends when the user has been inactive for some\ntime (for example, if there have been no events for 30 minutes).

To understand the situation better, let\u2019s\ndistinguish three different types of joins: stream-stream  joins, stream-table  joins, and\ntable-table  joins [ 84]. In the following sections we\u2019ll illustrate each by example.\nStream-stream join (window join)\nSay you have a search feature on your website, and you want to detect recent trends\nin searched-for URLs. Every time someone types a search query, you log an event\ncontaining the query and the results returned. Every time someone clicks one of the\nsearch results, you log another event recording the click. In order to calculate the\nclick-through rate for each URL in the search results, you need to bring together the\nevents for the search action and the click action, which are connected by having the\nsame session ID. Similar analyses are needed in advertising systems [ 85].\nThe click may never come if the user abandons their search, and even if it comes, the\ntime between the search and the click may be highly variable: in many cases it might\nbe a few seconds, but it could be as long as days or weeks (if a user runs a search,\nforgets about that browser tab, and then returns to the tab and clicks a result some\u2010\ntime later). Due to variable network delays, the click event may even arrive before the\nsearch event. You can choose a suitable window for the join\u2014for example, you may\nchoose to join a click with a search if they occur at most one hour apart.\nNote that embedding the details of the search in the click event is not equivalent to\njoining the events: doing so would only tell you about the cases where the user\nclicked a search result, not about the searches where the user did not click any of the\nresults. In order to measure search quality, you need accurate click-through rates, for\nwhich you need both the search events and the click events.\nTo implement this type of join, a stream processor needs to maintain state : for exam\u2010\nple, all the events that occurred in the last hour, indexed by session ID. Whenever a\nsearch event or click event occurs, it is added to the appropriate index, and the\nstream processor also checks the other index to see if another event for the same ses\u2010\nsion ID has already arrived. If there is a matching event, you emit an event saying\nwhich search result was clicked. If the search event expires without you seeing a\nmatching click event, you emit an event saying which search results were not clicked.\nStream-table join (stream enrichment)\nIn \u201cExample: analysis of user activity events\u201d on page 404 (Figure 10-2 ) we saw an\nexample of a batch job joining two datasets: a set of user activity events and a data\u2010\nbase of user profiles.

The database lookup could be implemented by querying a remote\ndatabase; however, as discussed in \u201cExample: analysis of user activity events\u201d  on page\n404, such remote queries are likely to be slow and risk overloading the database [ 75].\nAnother approach is to load a copy of the database into the stream processor so that\nit can be queried locally without a network round-trip.

For example, if you sell things, you\nneed to apply the right tax rate to invoices, which depends on the country or state,\nthe type of product, and the date of sale (since tax rates change from time to time).\nWhen joining sales to a table of tax rates, you probably want to join with the tax rate\nat the time of the sale, which may be different from the current tax rate if you are\nreprocessing historical data.\nIf the ordering of events across streams is undetermined, the join becomes nondeter\u2010\nministic [ 87], which means you cannot rerun the same job on the same input and\nnecessarily get the same result: the events on the input streams may be interleaved in\na different way when you run the job again.\nIn data warehouses, this issue is known as a slowly changing dimension  (SCD), and it\nis often addressed by using a unique identifier for a particular version of the joined\nrecord: for example, every time the tax rate changes, it is given a new identifier, and\nthe invoice includes the identifier for the tax rate at the time of sale [ 88, 89]. This\nchange makes the join deterministic, but has the consequence that log compaction is\nnot possible, since all versions of the records in the table need to be retained. \nFault Tolerance\nIn the final section of this chapter, let\u2019s consider how stream processors can tolerate\nfaults. We saw in Chapter 10  that batch processing frameworks can tolerate faults\nfairly easily: if a task in a MapReduce job fails, it can simply be started again on\nanother machine, and the output of the failed task is discarded. This transparent retry\nis possible because input files are immutable, each task writes its output to a separate\nfile on HDFS, and output is only made visible when a task completes successfully.\nIn particular, the batch approach to fault tolerance ensures that the output of the\nbatch job is the same as if nothing had gone wrong, even if in fact some tasks did fail.\nIt appears as though every input record was processed exactly once\u2014no records are\nskipped, and none are processed twice. Although restarting tasks means that records\nmay in fact be processed multiple times, the visible effect in the output is as if they\nhad only been processed once. This principle is known as exactly-once semantics ,\nalthough effectively-once  would be a more descriptive term [ 90].\nThe same issue of fault tolerance arises in stream processing, but it is less straightfor\u2010\nward to handle: waiting until a task is finished before making its output visible is not\nan option, because a stream is infinite and so you can never finish processing it.\n476 | Chapter 11: Stream Processing",

    "chunk": "Microbatching and checkpointing\nOne solution is to break the stream into small blocks, and treat each block like a min\u2010\niature batch process. This approach is called microbatching , and it is used in Spark\nStreaming [ 91]. The batch size is typically around one second, which is the result of a\nperformance compromise: smaller batches incur greater scheduling and coordination\noverhead, while larger batches mean a longer delay before results of the stream pro\u2010\ncessor become visible.\nMicrobatching also implicitly provides a tumbling window equal to the batch size\n(windowed by processing time, not event timestamps); any jobs that require larger\nwindows need to explicitly carry over state from one microbatch to the next.\nA variant approach, used in Apache Flink, is to periodically generate rolling check\u2010\npoints of state and write them to durable storage [ 92, 93]. If a stream operator\ncrashes, it can restart from its most recent checkpoint and discard any output gener\u2010\nated between the last checkpoint and the crash. The checkpoints are triggered by bar\u2010\nriers in the message stream, similar to the boundaries between microbatches, but\nwithout forcing a particular window size.\nWithin the confines of the stream processing framework, the microbatching and\ncheckpointing approaches provide the same exactly-once semantics as batch process\u2010\ning. However, as soon as output leaves the stream processor (for example, by writing\nto a database, sending messages to an external message broker, or sending emails),\nthe framework is no longer able to discard the output of a failed batch. In this case,\nrestarting a failed task causes the external side effect to happen twice, and micro\u2010\nbatching or checkpointing alone is not sufficient to prevent this problem.\nAtomic commit revisited\nIn order to give the appearance of exactly-once processing in the presence of faults,\nwe need to ensure that all outputs and side effects of processing an event take effect if\nand only if  the processing is successful. Those effects include any messages sent to\ndownstream operators or external messaging systems (including email or push notifi\u2010\ncations), any database writes, any changes to operator state, and any acknowledg\u2010\nment of input messages (including moving the consumer offset forward in a log-\nbased message broker).\nThose things either all need to happen atomically, or none of them must happen, but\nthey should not go out of sync with each other. If this approach sounds familiar, it is\nbecause we discussed it in \u201cExactly-once message processing\u201d on page 360  in the con\u2010\ntext of distributed transactions and two-phase commit.\nIn Chapter 9  we discussed the problems in the traditional implementations of dis\u2010\ntributed transactions, such as XA.

Unlike XA, these implementations do not\nattempt to provide transactions across heterogeneous technologies, but instead keep\nthem internal by managing both state changes and messaging within the stream pro\u2010\ncessing framework. The overhead of the transaction protocol can be amortized by\nprocessing several input messages within a single transaction.\nIdempotence\nOur goal is to discard the partial output of any failed tasks so that they can be safely\nretried without taking effect twice. Distributed transactions are one way of achieving\nthat goal, but another way is to rely on idempotence  [97].\nAn idempotent operation is one that you can perform multiple times, and it has the\nsame effect as if you performed it only once. For example, setting a key in a key-value\nstore to some fixed value is idempotent (writing the value again simply overwrites the\nvalue with an identical value), whereas incrementing a counter is not idempotent\n(performing the increment again means the value is incremented twice).\nEven if an operation is not naturally idempotent, it can often be made idempotent\nwith a bit of extra metadata. For example, when consuming messages from Kafka,\nevery message has a persistent, monotonically increasing offset. When writing a value\nto an external database, you can include the offset of the message that triggered the\nlast write with the value. Thus, you can tell whether an update has already been\napplied, and avoid performing the same update again.\nThe state handling in Storm\u2019s Trident is based on a similar idea [ 78]. Relying on\nidempotence implies several assumptions: restarting a failed task must replay the\nsame messages in the same order (a log-based message broker does this), the process\u2010\ning must be deterministic, and no other node may concurrently update the same\nvalue [ 98, 99].\nWhen failing over from one processing node to another, fencing may be required (see\n\u201cThe leader and the lock\u201d on page 301) to prevent interference from a node that is\nthought to be dead but is actually alive. Despite all those caveats, idempotent opera\u2010\ntions can be an effective way of achieving exactly-once semantics with only a small\noverhead.\nRebuilding state after a failure\nAny stream process that requires state\u2014for example, any windowed aggregations\n(such as counters, averages, and histograms) and any tables and indexes used for\njoins\u2014must ensure that this state can be recovered after a failure.\nOne option is to keep the state in a remote datastore and replicate it, although having\nto query a remote database for each individual message can be slow, as discussed in\n478 | Chapter 11: Stream Processing",

Then, when the stream\nprocessor is recovering from a failure, the new task can read the replicated state and\nresume processing without data loss.\nFor example, Flink periodically captures snapshots of operator state and writes them\nto durable storage such as HDFS [ 92, 93]; Samza and Kafka Streams replicate state\nchanges by sending them to a dedicated Kafka topic with log compaction, similar to\nchange data capture [ 84, 100]. VoltDB replicates state by redundantly processing\neach input message on several nodes (see \u201cActual Serial Execution\u201d on page 252 ).\nIn some cases, it may not even be necessary to replicate the state, because it can be\nrebuilt from the input streams. For example, if the state consists of aggregations over\na fairly short window, it may be fast enough to simply replay the input events corre\u2010\nsponding to that window. If the state is a local replica of a database, maintained by\nchange data capture, the database can also be rebuilt from the log-compacted change\nstream (see \u201cLog compaction\u201d on page 456 ).\nHowever, all of these trade-offs depend on the performance characteristics of the\nunderlying infrastructure: in some systems, network delay may be lower than disk\naccess latency, and network bandwidth may be comparable to disk bandwidth.

    "chunk": "Data Integration\nA recurring theme in this book has been that for any given problem, there are several\nsolutions, all of which have different pros, cons, and trade-offs. For example, when\ndiscussing storage engines in Chapter 3 , we saw log-structured storage, B-trees, and\ncolumn-oriented storage. When discussing replication in Chapter 5 , we saw single-\nleader, multi-leader, and leaderless approaches.\nIf you have a problem such as \u201cI want to store some data and look it up again later,\u201d\nthere is no one right solution, but many different approaches that are each appropri\u2010\nate in different circumstances. A software implementation typically has to pick one\nparticular approach. It\u2019s hard enough to get one code path robust and performing\nwell\u2014trying to do everything in one piece of software almost guarantees that the\nimplementation will be poor.\nThus, the most appropriate choice of software tool also depends on the circumstan\u2010\nces. Every piece of software, even a so-called \u201cgeneral-purpose\u201d database, is designed\nfor a particular usage pattern.\nFaced with this profusion of alternatives, the first challenge is then to figure out the\nmapping between the software products and the circumstances in which they are a\ngood fit. Vendors are understandably reluctant to tell you about the kinds of work\u2010\nloads for which their software is poorly suited, but hopefully the previous chapters\nhave equipped you with some questions to ask in order to read between the lines and\nbetter understand the trade-offs.\nHowever, even if you perfectly understand the mapping between tools and circum\u2010\nstances for their use, there is another challenge: in complex applications, data is often\nused in several different ways. There is unlikely to be one piece of software that is\nsuitable for all the different circumstances in which the data is used, so you inevitably\nend up having to cobble together several different pieces of software in order to pro\u2010\nvide your application\u2019s functionality.\nCombining Specialized Tools by Deriving Data\nFor example, it is common to need to integrate an OLTP database with a full-text\nsearch index in order to handle queries for arbitrary keywords. Although some data\u2010\nbases (such as PostgreSQL) include a full-text indexing feature, which can be suffi\u2010\ncient for simple applications [ 1], more sophisticated search facilities require specialist\ninformation retrieval tools. Conversely, search indexes are generally not very suitable\nas a durable system of record, and so many applications need to combine two differ\u2010\nent tools in order to satisfy all of the requirements.\nWe touched on the issue of integrating data systems in \u201cKeeping Systems in Sync\u201d  on\npage 452.

The need for data inte\u2010\ngration often only becomes apparent if you zoom out and consider the dataflows\nacross an entire organization.\nReasoning about dataflows\nWhen copies of the same data need to be maintained in several storage systems in\norder to satisfy different access patterns, you need to be very clear about the inputs\nand outputs: where is data written first, and which representations are derived from\nwhich sources? How do you get data into all the right places, in the right formats?\nFor example, you might arrange for data to first be written to a system of record data\u2010\nbase, capturing the changes made to that database (see \u201cChange Data Capture\u201d on\npage 454) and then applying the changes to the search index in the same order. If\nchange data capture (CDC) is the only way of updating the index, you can be confi\u2010\ndent that the index is entirely derived from the system of record, and therefore con\u2010\nsistent with it (barring bugs in the software). Writing to the database is the only way\nof supplying new input into this system.\nAllowing the application to directly write to both the search index and the database\nintroduces the problem shown in Figure 11-4 , in which two clients concurrently send\nconflicting writes, and the two storage systems process them in a different order. In\nthis case, neither the database nor the search index is \u201cin charge\u201d of determining the\norder of writes, and so they may make contradictory decisions and become perma\u2010\nnently inconsistent with each other.\nIf it is possible for you to funnel all user input through a single system that decides on\nan ordering for all writes, it becomes much easier to derive other representations of\nthe data by processing the writes in the same order. This is an application of the state\nmachine replication approach that we saw in \u201cTotal Order Broadcast\u201d  on page 348.\nWhether you use change data capture or an event sourcing log is less important than\nsimply the principle of deciding on a total order.\nData Integration | 491",

However, as systems are scaled\ntoward bigger and more complex workloads, limitations begin to emerge:\n\u2022In most cases, constructing a totally ordered log requires all events to pass\nthrough a single leader node  that decides on the ordering. If the throughput of\nevents is greater than a single machine can handle, you need to partition it across\nmultiple machines (see \u201cPartitioned Logs\u201d on page 446). The order of events in\ntwo different partitions is then ambiguous.\n\u2022If the servers are spread across multiple geographically distributed  datacenters,\nfor example in order to tolerate an entire datacenter going offline, you typically\nhave a separate leader in each datacenter, because network delays make synchro\u2010\nnous cross-datacenter coordination inefficient (see \u201cMulti-Leader Replication\u201d\non page 168). This implies an undefined ordering of events that originate in two\ndifferent datacenters.\n\u2022When applications are deployed as microservices  (see \u201cDataflow Through Serv\u2010\nices: REST and RPC\u201d on page 131), a common design choice is to deploy each\nservice and its durable state as an independent unit, with no durable state shared\nbetween services.

With such appli\u2010\ncations, clients and servers are very likely to see events in different orders.\nIn formal terms, deciding on a total order of events is known as total order broadcast ,\nwhich is equivalent to consensus (see \u201cConsensus algorithms and total order broad\u2010\ncast\u201d  on page 366). Most consensus algorithms are designed for situations in which\nthe throughput of a single node is sufficient to process the entire stream of events,\nand these algorithms do not provide a mechanism for multiple nodes to share the\nwork of ordering the events. It is still an open research problem to design consensus\nalgorithms that can scale beyond the throughput of a single node and that work well\nin a geographically distributed setting.\nOrdering events to capture causality\nIn cases where there is no causal link between events, the lack of a total order is not a\nbig problem, since concurrent events can be ordered arbitrarily.

Trains built for\none gauge couldn\u2019t run on tracks of another gauge, which restricted the possible\ninterconnections in the train network [ 9].\nAfter a single standard gauge was finally decided upon in 1846, tracks with other\ngauges had to be converted\u2014but how do you do this without shutting down the train\nline for months or years? The solution is to first convert the track to dual gauge  or\nmixed gauge  by adding a third rail. This conversion can be done gradually, and when\nit is done, trains of both gauges can run on the line, using two of the three rails. Even\u2010\ntually, once all trains have been converted to the standard gauge, the rail providing\nthe nonstandard gauge can be removed.\n\u201cReprocessing\u201d the existing tracks in this way, and allowing the old and new versions\nto exist side by side, makes it possible to change the gauge gradually over the course\nof years.

A database stores data in records of some data model (rows in tables, docu\u2010\nments, vertices in a graph, etc.) while an operating system\u2019s filesystem stores data in\nfiles\u2014but at their core, both are \u201cinformation management\u201d systems [ 17]. As we saw\nin Chapter 10 , the Hadoop ecosystem is somewhat like a distributed version of Unix.\nOf course, there are many practical differences. For example, many filesystems do not\ncope very well with a directory containing 10 million small files, whereas a database\ncontaining 10 million small records is completely normal and unremarkable. Never\u2010\ntheless, the similarities and differences between operating systems and databases are\nworth exploring.\nUnix and relational databases have approached the information management prob\u2010\nlem with very different philosophies. Unix viewed its purpose as presenting program\u2010\nmers with a logical but fairly low-level hardware abstraction, whereas relational\ndatabases wanted to give application programmers a high-level abstraction that\nwould hide the complexities of data structures on disk, concurrency, crash recovery,\nand so on. Unix developed pipes and files that are just sequences of bytes, whereas\ndatabases developed SQL and transactions.\nWhich approach is better? Of course, it depends what you want. Unix is \u201csimpler\u201d in\nthe sense that it is a fairly thin wrapper around hardware resources; relational data\u2010\nbases are \u201csimpler\u201d in the sense that a short declarative query can draw on a lot of\npowerful infrastructure (query optimization, indexes, join methods, concurrency\ncontrol, replication, etc.) without the author of the query needing to understand the\nimplementation details.\nThe tension between these philosophies has lasted for decades (both Unix and the\nrelational model emerged in the early 1970s) and still isn\u2019t resolved. For example, I\nwould interpret the NoSQL movement as wanting to apply a Unix-esque approach of\nlow-level abstractions to the domain of distributed OLTP data storage.\nIn this section I will attempt to reconcile the two philosophies, in the hope that we\ncan combine the best of both worlds.\nComposing Data Storage Technologies\nOver the course of this book we have discussed various features provided by data\u2010\nbases and how they work, including:\n\u2022Secondary indexes, which allow you to efficiently search for records based on the\nvalue of a field (see \u201cOther Indexing Structures\u201d on page 85 )\nUnbundling Databases | 499",

Once that is done, the database must continue to keep the index up\nto date whenever a transaction writes to the table.\nThis process is remarkably similar to setting up a new follower replica (see \u201cSetting\nUp New Followers\u201d  on page 155), and also very similar to bootstrapping change data\ncapture in a streaming system (see \u201cInitial snapshot\u201d on page 455 ).\nWhenever you run CREATE INDEX , the database essentially reprocesses the existing\ndataset (as discussed in \u201cReprocessing data for application evolution\u201d  on page 496)\nand derives the index as a new view onto the existing data.

However, when a transaction would need to involve systems\nwritten by different groups of people (e.g., when data is written from a stream pro\u2010\ncessor to a distributed key-value store or search index), the lack of a standardized\ntransaction protocol makes integration much harder. An ordered log of events with\nidempotent consumers (see \u201cIdempotence\u201d  on page 478) is a much simpler abstrac\u2010\ntion, and thus much more feasible to implement across heterogeneous systems [ 7].\nThe big advantage of log-based integration is loose coupling  between the various com\u2010\nponents, which manifests itself in two ways:\n1.At a system level, asynchronous event streams make the system as a whole more\nrobust to outages or performance degradation of individual components. If a\nconsumer runs slow or fails, the event log can buffer messages (see \u201cDisk space\nusage\u201d on page 450 ), allowing the producer and any other consumers to continue\nrunning unaffected.

Dual writes are\nalso ruled out (see \u201cKeeping Systems in Sync\u201d on page 452 ).\n\u2022Fault tolerance is key for derived data: losing just a single message causes the\nderived dataset to go permanently out of sync with its data source. Both message\ndelivery and derived state updates must be reliable. For example, many actor sys\u2010\ntems by default maintain actor state and messages in memory, so they are lost if\nthe machine running the actor crashes.\nStable message ordering and fault-tolerant message processing are quite stringent\ndemands, but they are much less expensive and more operationally robust than dis\u2010\ntributed transactions.

In this context, exactly-once  means arranging the compu\u2010\ntation such that the final effect is the same as if no faults had occurred, even if the\noperation actually was retried due to some fault. We previously discussed a few\napproaches for achieving this goal.\nOne of the most effective approaches is to make the operation idempotent  (see\n\u201cIdempotence\u201d  on page 478); that is, to ensure that it has the same effect, no matter\nwhether it is executed once or multiple times. However, taking an operation that is\nnot naturally idempotent and making it idempotent requires some effort and care:\nyou may need to maintain some additional metadata (such as the set of operation IDs\nthat have updated a value), and ensure fencing when failing over from one node to\nanother (see \u201cThe leader and the lock\u201d on page 301 ).\nDuplicate suppression\nThe same pattern of needing to suppress duplicates occurs in many other places\nbesides stream processing. For example, TCP uses sequence numbers on packets to\nput them in the correct order at the recipient, and to determine whether any packets\nwere lost or duplicated on the network. Any lost packets are retransmitted and any\nduplicates are removed by the TCP stack before it hands the data to an application.\nHowever, this duplicate suppression only works within the context of a single TCP\nconnection. Imagine the TCP connection is a client\u2019s connection to a database, and it\nis currently executing the transaction in Example 12-1 . In many databases, a transac\u2010\ntion is tied to a client connection (if the client sends several queries, the database\nknows that they belong to the same transaction because they are sent on the same\nTCP connection). If the client suffers a network interruption and connection timeout\nafter sending the COMMIT , but before hearing back from the database server, it does\nnot know whether the transaction has been committed or aborted ( Figure 8-1 ).\nExample 12-1. A nonidempotent transfer of money from one account to another\nBEGIN TRANSACTION ;\nUPDATE accounts  SET balance = balance + 11.00 WHERE account_id  = 1234;\nUPDATE accounts  SET balance = balance - 11.00 WHERE account_id  = 4321;\nCOMMIT;\nThe client can reconnect to the database and retry the transaction, but now it is out\u2010\nside of the scope of TCP duplicate suppression. Since the transaction in Example 12-1\nis not idempotent, it could happen that $22 is transferred instead of the desired $11.\nThus, even though Example 12-1  is a standard example for transaction atomicity, it is\nactually not correct, and real banks do not work like this [ 3].\nTwo-phase commit (see \u201cAtomic Commit and Two-Phase Commit (2PC)\u201d  on page\n354) protocols break the 1:1 mapping between a TCP connection and a transaction,\nsince they must allow a transaction coordinator to reconnect to a database after a net\u2010\nAiming for Correctness | 517",

Techni\u2010\nques that enforce uniqueness can often be used for these kinds of constraints as well.\nUniqueness constraints require consensus\nIn Chapter 9  we saw that in a distributed setting, enforcing a uniqueness constraint\nrequires consensus: if there are several concurrent requests with the same value, the\nsystem somehow needs to decide which one of the conflicting operations is accepted,\nand reject the others as violations of the constraint.\nThe most common way of achieving this consensus is to make a single node the\nleader, and put it in charge of making all the decisions.

For example, if you need to ensure uniqueness by request ID, as in\nExample 12-2 , you can ensure all requests with the same request ID are routed to the\nsame partition (see Chapter 6 ). If you need usernames to be unique, you can partition\nby hash of username.\nHowever, asynchronous multi-master replication is ruled out, because it could hap\u2010\npen that different masters concurrently accept conflicting writes, and thus the values\nare no longer unique (see \u201cImplementing Linearizable Systems\u201d  on page 332).

Since there is now\ncross-partition coordination, different partitions can no longer be processed inde\u2010\npendently, so throughput is likely to suffer.\nHowever, it turns out that equivalent correctness can be achieved with partitioned\nlogs, and without an atomic commit:\n1.The request to transfer money from account A to account B is given a unique\nrequest ID by the client, and appended to a log partition based on the request ID.\n2.A stream processor reads the log of requests. For each request message it emits\ntwo messages to output streams: a debit instruction to the payer account A (par\u2010\ntitioned by A), and a credit instruction to the payee account B (partitioned by B).\nThe original request ID is included in those emitted messages.\n3.Further processors consume the streams of credit and debit instructions, dedu\u2010\nplicate by request ID, and apply the changes to the account balances.\nSteps 1 and 2 are necessary because if the client directly sent the credit and debit\ninstructions, it would require an atomic commit across those two partitions to ensure\nthat either both or neither happen. To avoid the need for a distributed transaction,\nwe first durably log the request as a single message, and then derive the credit and\ndebit instructions from that first message. Single-object writes are atomic in almost\nall data systems (see \u201cSingle-object writes\u201d on page 230), and so the request either\nappears in the log or it doesn\u2019t, without any need for a multi-partition atomic com\u2010\nmit.\nIf the stream processor in step 2 crashes, it resumes processing from its last check\u2010\npoint. In doing so, it does not skip any request messages, but it may process requests\nmultiple times and produce duplicate credit and debit instructions. However, since it\nis deterministic, it will just produce the same instructions again, and the processors in\nstep 3 can easily deduplicate them using the end-to-end request ID.\nIf you want to ensure that the payer account is not overdrawn by this transfer, you\ncan additionally have a stream processor (partitioned by payer account number) that\nmaintains account balances and validates transactions. Only valid transactions would\nthen be placed in the request log in step 1.\nBy breaking down the multi-partition transaction into two differently partitioned\nstages and using the end-to-end request ID, we have achieved the same correctness\nproperty (every request is applied exactly once to both the payer and payee accounts),\neven in the presence of faults, and without using an atomic commit protocol.

However, it is possible for a client\nto wait for a message to appear on an output stream. This is what we did in \u201cUnique\u2010\nness in log-based messaging\u201d on page 522 when checking whether a uniqueness con\u2010\nstraint was satisfied.\nIn this example, the correctness of the uniqueness check does not depend on whether\nthe sender of the message waits for the outcome. The waiting only has the purpose of\nsynchronously informing the sender whether or not the uniqueness check succeeded,\nbut this notification can be decoupled from the effects of processing the message.\nMore generally, I think the term consistency  conflates two different requirements that\nare worth considering separately:\nTimeliness\nTimeliness means ensuring that users observe the system in an up-to-date state.\nWe saw previously that if a user reads from a stale copy of the data, they may\nobserve it in an inconsistent state (see \u201cProblems with Replication Lag\u201d on page\n161). However, that inconsistency is temporary, and will eventually be resolved\nsimply by waiting and trying again.\nThe CAP theorem (see \u201cThe Cost of Linearizability\u201d on page 335) uses consis\u2010\ntency in the sense of linearizability, which is a strong way of achieving timeliness.\nWeaker timeliness properties like read-after-write  consistency (see \u201cReading\nYour Own Writes\u201d on page 162 ) can also be useful.\nIntegrity\nIntegrity means absence of corruption; i.e., no data loss, and no contradictory or\nfalse data. In particular, if some derived dataset is maintained as a view onto\nsome underlying data (see \u201cDeriving current state from the event log\u201d on page\n458), the derivation must be correct.

Atomicity and durability are important\ntools for preserving integrity.\nIn slogan form: violations of timeliness are \u201ceventual consistency,\u201d whereas violations\nof integrity are \u201cperpetual inconsistency.\u201d\nI am going to assert that in most applications, integrity is much more important than\ntimeliness. Violations of timeliness can be annoying and confusing, but violations of\nintegrity can be catastrophic.\nFor example, on your credit card statement, it is not surprising if a transaction that\nyou made within the last 24 hours does not yet appear\u2014it is normal that these sys\u2010\ntems have a certain lag. We know that banks reconcile and settle transactions asyn\u2010\nchronously, and timeliness is not very important here [ 3]. However, it would be very\nbad if the statement balance was not equal to the sum of the transactions plus the\nprevious statement balance (an error in the sums), or if a transaction was charged to\nyou but not paid to the merchant (disappearing money). Such problems would be\nviolations of the integrity of the system.\nCorrectness of dataflow systems\nACID transactions usually provide both timeliness (e.g., linearizability) and integrity\n(e.g., atomic commit) guarantees. Thus, if you approach application correctness from\nthe point of view of ACID transactions, the distinction between timeliness and integ\u2010\nrity is fairly inconsequential.\nOn the other hand, an interesting property of the event-based dataflow systems that\nwe have discussed in this chapter is that they decouple timeliness and integrity. When\nprocessing event streams asynchronously, there is no guarantee of timeliness, unless\nyou explicitly build consumers that wait for a message to arrive before returning. But\nintegrity is in fact central to streaming systems.\nExactly-once  or effectively-once  semantics (see \u201cFault Tolerance\u201d  on page 476) is a\nmechanism for preserving integrity. If an event is lost, or if an event takes effect\ntwice, the integrity of a data system could be violated.

Let\u2019s think for a moment about designing for audita\u2010\nbility.\nDesigning for auditability\nIf a transaction mutates several objects in a database, it is difficult to tell after the fact\nwhat that transaction means. Even if you capture the transaction logs (see \u201cChange\nData Capture\u201d on page 454), the insertions, updates, and deletions in various tables\ndo not necessarily give a clear picture of why those mutations were performed. The\ninvocation of the application logic that decided on those mutations is transient and\ncannot be reproduced.\nBy contrast, event-based systems can provide better auditability. In the event sourc\u2010\ning approach, user input to the system is represented as a single immutable event,\nand any resulting state updates are derived from that event. The derivation can be\nmade deterministic and repeatable, so that running the same log of events through\nthe same version of the derivation code will result in the same state updates.\nBeing explicit about dataflow (see \u201cPhilosophy of batch process outputs\u201d  on page\n413) makes the provenance  of data much clearer, which makes integrity checking\nmuch more feasible. For the event log, we can use hashes to check that the event stor\u2010\nage has not been corrupted. For any derived state, we can rerun the batch and stream\nprocessors that derived it from the event log in order to check whether we get the\nsame result, or even run a redundant derivation in parallel.\nA deterministic and well-defined dataflow also makes it easier to debug and trace the\nexecution of a system in order to determine why it did something [ 4, 69]. If some\u2010\nthing unexpected occurred, it is valuable to have the diagnostic capability to repro\u2010\nduce the exact circumstances that led to the unexpected event\u2014a kind of time-travel\ndebugging capability.\nThe end-to-end argument again\nIf we cannot fully trust that every individual component of the system will be free\nfrom corruption\u2014that every piece of hardware is fault-free and that every piece of\nsoftware is bug-free\u2014then we must at least periodically check the integrity of our\ndata. If we don\u2019t check, we won\u2019t find out about corruption until it is too late and it\nhas caused some downstream damage, at which point it will be much harder and\nmore expensive to track down the problem.\nChecking the integrity of data systems is best done in an end-to-end fashion (see\n\u201cThe End-to-End Argument for Databases\u201d on page 516): the more systems we can\nAiming for Correctness | 531",

However, from a data systems point of view they\ncontain some interesting ideas. Essentially, they are distributed databases, with a data\nmodel and transaction mechanism, in which different replicas can be hosted by\nmutually untrusting organizations. The replicas continually check each other\u2019s integ\u2010\nrity and use a consensus protocol to agree on the transactions that should be exe\u2010\ncuted.\nI am somewhat skeptical about the Byzantine fault tolerance aspects of these technol\u2010\nogies (see \u201cByzantine Faults\u201d on page 304), and I find the technique of proof of work\n(e.g., Bitcoin mining) extraordinarily wasteful.

However, we have left out an important and fundamental\npart of the discussion, which I would now like to fill in.\nEvery system is built for a purpose; every action we take has both intended and unin\u2010\ntended consequences. The purpose may be as simple as making money, but the con\u2010\nsequences for the world may reach far beyond that original purpose. We, the\nengineers building these systems, have a responsibility to carefully consider those\nconsequences and to consciously decide what kind of world we want to live in.\nWe talk about data as an abstract thing, but remember that many datasets are about\npeople: their behavior, their interests, their identity. We must treat such data with\nhumanity and respect. Users are humans too, and human dignity is paramount.\nSoftware development increasingly involves making important ethical choices. There\nare guidelines to help software engineers navigate these issues, such as the ACM\u2019s\nSoftware Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice [ 77], but they are\nrarely discussed, applied, and enforced in practice. As a result, engineers and product\nmanagers sometimes take a very cavalier attitude to privacy and potential negative\nconsequences of their products [ 78, 79, 80].\nA technology is not good or bad in itself\u2014what matters is how it is used and how it\naffects people.

I think it is not sufficient for software engi\u2010\nneers to focus exclusively on the technology and ignore its consequences: the ethical\nresponsibility is ours to bear also. Reasoning about ethics is difficult, but it is too\nimportant to ignore.\nPredictive Analytics\nFor example, predictive analytics is a major part of the \u201cBig Data\u201d hype. Using data\nanalysis to predict the weather, or the spread of diseases, is one thing [ 81]; it is\nanother matter to predict whether a convict is likely to reoffend, whether an applicant\nfor a loan is likely to default, or whether an insurance customer is likely to make\nexpensive claims.

The right to privacy is a decision right: it enables each person to decide\nwhere they want to be on the spectrum between secrecy and transparency in each sit\u2010\nuation [ 99]. It is an important aspect of a person\u2019s freedom and autonomy.\nWhen data is extracted from people through surveillance infrastructure, privacy\nrights are not necessarily eroded, but rather transferred to the data collector. Compa\u2010\nnies that acquire data essentially say \u201ctrust us to do the right thing with your data,\u201d\nwhich means that the right to decide what to reveal and what to keep secret is trans\u2010\nferred from the individual to the company.\nThe companies in turn choose to keep much of the outcome of this surveillance\nsecret, because to reveal it would be perceived as creepy, and would harm their busi\u2010\nness model (which relies on knowing more about people than other companies do).\nIntimate information about users is only revealed indirectly, for example in the form\nof tools for targeting advertisements to specific groups of people (such as those suf\u2010\nfering from a particular illness).\nDoing the Right Thing | 539",

Factory owners lived in splendor, while urban workers often\nlived in very poor housing and worked long hours in harsh conditions. Child labor\nwas common, including dangerous and poorly paid work in mines.\nIt took a long time before safeguards were established, such as environmental protec\u2010\ntion regulations, safety protocols for workplaces, outlawing child labor, and health\ninspections for food.

Similarly, if some\u2010\nthing goes wrong, you can fix the code and reprocess the data in order to recover.\nThese processes are quite similar to what databases already do internally, so we recast\nthe idea of dataflow applications as unbundling  the components of a database, and\nbuilding an application by composing these loosely coupled components.\nDerived state can be updated by observing changes in the underlying data. Moreover,\nthe derived state itself can further be observed by downstream consumers. We can\neven take this dataflow all the way through to the end-user device that is displaying\nthe data, and thus build user interfaces that dynamically update to reflect data\nchanges and continue to work offline.\nNext, we discussed how to ensure that all of this processing remains correct in the\npresence of faults. We saw that strong integrity guarantees can be implemented scala\u2010\nbly with asynchronous event processing, by using end-to-end operation identifiers to\nmake operations idempotent and by checking constraints asynchronously.

We then talked a little about using audits to verify the integrity of data\nand detect corruption.\nFinally, we took a step back and examined some ethical aspects of building data-\nintensive applications.
