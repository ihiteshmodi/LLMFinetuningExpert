Given a 10 percent chance of\na 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you're still going to be wrong nine times out of ten . . . We all know that if you swing\nfor the fences, you're going to strike out a lot, but you're also going to hit some home runs. The difference between baseball and business,\nhowever, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you\ncan get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns\nis why it's important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments.\"\nJEFF BEZOS\nAs entrepreneurs, we make bets everyday. We are gamblers \n―\n gambling our hard-earned money on labor, inventory, rent,\nmarketing, etc., all with the hopes of a higher pay out. Oftentimes, we lose. But, sometimes, we win and win BIG.\nHowever, there is a difference between gambling in business and gambling in a casino. In a casino, the odds are stacked\nagainst you.

I call the proper combination of these\ncomponents: a \nGrand Slam Offer\n.\nI chose this term partially in homage to the above quote from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and because, like a grand slam in\nbaseball, a Grand Slam Offer is both very good and very rare. Additionally, to extend the baseball metaphor, it takes no more\neffort to make a Grand Slam Offer than to strike out. The difference is dictated by the skill of the marketer and how well he\nconnects his offer with his audience’s desires. In business you can have so-so offers: the “singles” and “doubles’ that keep the\ngame going, pay the bills, and keep the lights on. But, unlike baseball, where a grand slam scores a maximum of four runs, a\nGrand Slam Offer in the business world, can score you a thousand-fold pay off and result in a world where you never need to\nwork again. It would be like connecting with the ball so well during one single at bat that you automatically win every World\nSeries for the next hundred years.\nIt takes years of practice to make something as complicated as hitting a major league fastball into the bleachers look\neffortless. Your stance, vision, prediction, ball speed, bat speed, and hip placement all must be perfect.

I had paid $3,000 of money I didn't\nhave to get a seat at the table. I knew I needed to learn. Everyone there had a business . . . except me. I was planning on starting\none, a gym.\nTJ, the organizer, had multiple successful businesses. While going over the agenda, I remember he made an off-hand\ncomment about making $1,000,000 that year.\nOne. Million. Dollars. I was spellbound. \nI wanna be like this guy. I’ll do anything.\n The problem was, I didn't know what\nany of them were talking about. KPIs? CPLs? Conversion rates? My head was spinning as I pretended like I knew what they\nwere talking about. But I didn’t, and I’m bad at pretending.\nBetween “sessions,” TJ found me. He could tell I was in way over my head. TJ was kind, curious, and caring. After a little\nbit of small talk, he asked me a simple question that changed my life forever . . .\n“Do you want to know the secret to sales?”\nI had never sold anything in my life.

I’m doing it. I’ll make it work.”\nAnd made it work they did.\nMost of us open up shop with the intention of helping people in some way. Many times, this assistance is in some way\nrelated to something that’s affected us personally. We set out to “give back” by providing value to others by helping them solve\na problem that once plagued us. Then again, sometimes this isn’t our way in. In either case, we cling to the dream of making\nmore and being freer than we are now.\nMany of us thought, naively, that owning a business would be our crowning accomplishment — a final destination — when\nin reality, it was just the beginning.\nSomehow, in the transition between “passionate to help others” and “owning my first business,” we gradually realized that", "output": "## Frameworks\n\n*   “Make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying no.”\n\n## Key Ideas/Steps\n\n*   **The Core Principle:** The most effective selling strategy is to present an offer so compelling that the prospect feels foolish for declining.\n*   **Transition from Wantrepreneur to Entrepreneur:** Recognizing the discomfort of the current situation drives the leap into entrepreneurship.\n*   **Motivations for Starting a Business:** Often rooted in a desire for freedom and a desire to help others (often stemming from personal experience).\n*   **Business as a Beginning, Not an End:**  Owning a business is a catalyst for further growth and opportunities, not the ultimate goal.\n\n## Copywriting Formulas\n\n*   **Implied AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action):** The entire concept revolves around creating an offer that grabs attention, generates interest, ignites desire, and compels action (saying yes).\n\n## Case Examples/Stories\n\n*   **The Narrator's Transformation:** The speaker's initial frustration as a \"wantrepreneur\" and the realization of the importance of a compelling offer.\n\n\n## High-Level Topics\n\n*   Naming (Implicit - the focus on creating irresistible offers)\n*   Psychology (Understanding prospect behavior and motivations)\n*   Copywriting (The concept of crafting irresistible offers)", "metadata": {"source": "Alex Hormozi 100m Offers"}}

Frameworks:**\n\n*   **The “Value” Framework:** Hormozi consistently emphasizes that pricing should be driven by the *perceived value* a product or service provides to the customer, not simply by the cost of production or a competitor’s price.\n*   **Tiered Pricing Based on Value:** This involves offering multiple pricing tiers, each reflecting a different level of value and addressing different customer segments.\n\n\n**2. Bullet Points for Key Ideas or Steps:**\n\n*   **Don’t Undersell:** The biggest mistake is underpricing.  It establishes a perception of low value.\n*   **Identify the Pain Point:**  Understand *exactly* what problem your product/service solves for the customer.  The more intense the pain, the more you can charge.\n*   **Quantify the Value:**  Convert the benefit into a quantifiable number (e.g., “saves you $X per month,” “increases your revenue by Y%”).\n*   **Multiple Pricing Tiers:** Offer options catering to different budgets and needs.  Consider “good,” “better,” and “best” – each with a clearly defined value proposition.\n*   **Focus on the Outcome, Not the Features:** Sell the *result* customers will achieve, not just the features of your product.\n*   **Create Scarcity:**  Limited-time offers, limited quantities, and exclusivity create a sense of urgency and justify higher prices.\n\n\n\n**3. Q&A (Implied or Stated Questions with Answers):**\n\n*   **Q: “How do I know what price to charge?”**\n    *   **A:** “It’s about the pain. If the pain is high, you can charge a lot.  Start with a high number and test.  Your goal isn’t to *sell* the high number, it’s to prove that the customer is willing to pay it.”\n*   **Q: “What if people don’t understand the value?”**\n    *   **A:** “You *teach* them the value.  Don’t just tell them; *show* them.  Use case studies, testimonials, and demonstrate the results they'll see.”\n\n\n\n**4. Case Examples or Stories:**\n\n*   **The $100,000 Product:** Hormozi uses the example of a product sold for $100,000 – *not* because it’s inherently worth that much, but because the customer was experiencing a pain of $500,000 in lost revenue.  He emphasizes this is *illustrative* – the key is understanding the pain.\n*   **Focus on Marketing Agencies:** He often uses marketing agencies as a case study. Agencies can charge massive fees because they’re solving the problem of a company that's not growing, which is a multi-million dollar pain point.\n\n\n\n**5. Copywriting Formulas:**\n\n*   **PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution):** While not explicitly named, this framework is heavily implied. Hormozi consistently frames the customer’s problem, then amplifies the negative consequences, and finally presents his solution.\n\n\n\n**6. High-Level Topics:**\n\n*   **Pricing Strategy**\n*   **Value-Based Pricing**\n*   **Psychology of Pricing** (influenced by Pain/Loss Aversion)\n\n\n**7. Step-by-Step Guide: How to Charge Lots of Money**\n\n1.  **Identify the Customer’s Pain:** Thoroughly understand the customer's biggest problem, challenge, or loss.\n2.  **Quantify the Pain:** Determine the monetary value of that pain – how much money is the customer losing due to the problem? (e.g., lost revenue, wasted time, increased costs).\n3.  **Determine Your Value:**  Based on the quantified pain, decide on your *minimum* price point. Your product should demonstrably alleviate more than just the problem – it should provide a significant advantage.\n4.  **Create Tiered Pricing:** Develop multiple pricing tiers, each reflecting a different level of value. Consider the following:\n    *   **Good:**  Basic solution addressing the core pain.\n    *   **Better:** Enhanced features and support.\n    *   **Best:** Premium features, dedicated support, and potentially a more strategic partnership.\n5.  **Communicate Value Clearly:**  Don't just list features; clearly articulate the *outcome* the customer will achieve with each tier.\n6.  **Test and Iterate:** Monitor your pricing and adjust based on customer feedback and sales data. Be prepared to increase your prices if demand supports it.", "metadata": {"source": "Alex Hormozi 100m Offers"}}

We believe every person, every company, and every organism is either\ngrowing or dying. Maintenance is a myth.\nWhat this means is, if your company isn’t growing, it’s dying. This is a sobering reality for many of us. I learned the hard\nway, and my businesses suffered for a long time because of it.\nLet me explain. The market is continuously growing. The stock market grows at 9 percent per year. If we aren't growing at\n9 percent per year, we are falling behind. “Maintenance,” in the most generic sense, would be 9 percent growth year over year.\nFurthermore, if you’re in a growing marketplace, then you might have to grow at 20-30 percent per year, just to keep up, or\nrisk falling behind. So you can see how maintenance is a myth.\nSo, then,what does it take to grow? Thankfully, just three simple things:\n1\n. \nGet more customers\n2\n. \nIncrease their average purchase value\n3\n. \nGet them to buy more times\nThat’s it.\nSure, there are lots of ways to acquire customers and zillions of ways to increase order value and purchase frequency, but,\nsimply put, that’s it. Those are the only three ways to grow.\nExample: If I sell 10 clients a month, and a client is worth $1,000 to me over their lifetime (through avg cart value x avg\nnumber of purchases), then my business will cap at $10,000/mo (10 x $1,000).\n10 New Clients/mo x $1000 Lifetime Value = $10,000/mo max revenue.\nIf you want to grow, you’ve got to either sell more clients every month (while maintaining suitable margins) or have them\nbe worth more (by increasing the profit per purchase or number of times they buy). That’s it.\nAuthor Note - Only Two Ways to Grow\nTo simplify this concept even more.

Low prices! ….Best taste!”\nThe students kept going until eventually they had run out of answers. They looked at each other waiting for the professor to\nspeak. The room finally fell quiet.\nThe professor smiled and replied, “\nA starving crowd.”\nYou could have the worst hot dogs, terrible prices, and be in a terrible location, but if you’re the only hot dog stand in town\nand the local college football game breaks out, you’re going to sell out. That’s the value of a starving crowd.\nAt the end of the day, if there is a ton of demand for a solution, you can be mediocre at business, have a terrible offer, and\nhave no ability to persuade people, and you can \nstill\n make money.\nAn example of this was the toilet paper shortage at the beginning of Covid-19. There was no offer. The pricing was\natrocious. And there was no compelling sales pitch. But because the crowd was so big and so starving, rolls of toilet paper\nwere going for $100 or more. That’s the value of a starving crowd.\nSelling Newspapers\nA good friend of mine, Lloyd, owned a software business that served newspapers for almost a decade.

So if they made nothing, neither did he. It was pure gain for the papers and a great\noffer.\nBut, despite having a great offer and natural sales ability, his business began to decline.

And remember that picking a market, like anything, is always our choice, so choose wisely.\nIn order to sell anything, you need demand. We are not trying to \ncreate\n demand. We are trying to \nchannel\n it. That is a very\nimportant distinction. If you don’t have a market for your offer, nothing that follows will work. This entire book sits atop the\nassumption that you have at least a “normal” market, which I define as a market that is growing at the same rate as the\nmarketplace and that has common unmet needs that fall into one of three categories: improved health, increased wealth, or\nimproved relationships. For example Lloyd, from the above newspaper story, could have gone through this entire book and\nnothing in here would have worked for him. Why? Because he would be targeting newspapers, a dying market.\nThat being said, having a great market is an advantage. \nBut you can be in a normal\n \nmarket that’s growing at an average rate\nand still make crazy money\n.

Every market I have been in has been a normal market. You just don't \nactually\n want to be selling\nice to eskimos.\nHere are the basic tenets of what I look for in markets. Let’s run through them before we return to the offer.\nWhen picking markets, I look for four indicators:\n1) Massive Pain\nThey must not want, but desperately need, what I am offering. Pain can be anything that frustrates people about their lives.\nBeing broke is painful. A bad marriage is painful. Waiting in line at the grocery stores is painful. Back pain . . . ugly smile pain\n. . . overweight pain . . . Humans suffer a lot. So for us entrepreneurs, endless opportunity abounds.\nThe degree of the pain will be proportional to the price you will be able to charge (more on this in the Value Equation\nchapter). When they hear the solution to their pain, and inversely, what their life would look like \nwithout\n this pain, they should\nbe drawn to your solution.\nI have a saying I use to train sales teams \n“The pain is the pitch.”\n If you can articulate the pain a prospect is feeling\naccurately, they will almost always buy what you are offering. A prospect must have a painful problem for us to solve and\ncharge money for our solution.\nPro Tip\nThe point of good writing is for the reader to \nunderstand\n.\nThe point of good persuasion is for the prospect to feel \nunderstood.\n2) Purchasing Power\nA friend of mine had a very good system for helping people improve their resumes to get more job interviews. He was\ngreat at it. But try as he did, he just could not get people to pay for his services. Why? Because they were all unemployed!\nThis, again, may seem obvious. But he thought, \n“These people are easy to target. They’re in\n \nmassive pain. There are\nplenty of them, and it's constantly adding new people. This is a great market!”", "output": "## Frameworks\n\n*   **Pain is the Pitch:** Articulating a prospect's pain accurately drives sales.\n*   **Value Equation:** Pain level dictates the price point.\n\n## Key Ideas/Steps\n\n*   **Market Selection:** Focus on markets with “Massive Pain” – persistent frustrations in people’s lives.\n*   **Pain as a Driver:** Prospects must *desperately* need a solution to buy it.\n*   **Purchasing Power is Crucial:**  Target markets with sufficient financial resources to afford the solution.\n\n## Q&A\n\n*   **Question:** What’s the most important factor when choosing a market?\n    *   **Answer:** Massive Pain – a persistent, deeply felt frustration.\n*   **Question:** What determines the price you can charge?\n    *   **Answer:** The degree of the pain experienced by the target audience.\n\n## Case Examples/Stories\n\n*   **Friend's Resume Service:** A friend successfully developed a system for helping people improve their resumes but failed to generate sales because the target audience (unemployed individuals) lacked purchasing power.\n\n## Copywriting Formulas\n\n*   **Implicit AIDA:**  The content implicitly utilizes AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) by focusing on identifying a painful problem (Attention), presenting a solution to alleviate it (Interest & Desire), and aiming to drive a purchase (Action).\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide: Finding a Profitable Market\n\n1.  **Identify Pain Points:** Research and pinpoint persistent frustrations experienced by a specific group of people.

Is it a minor annoyance or a deeply debilitating issue?  The more significant the pain, the more valuable your solution can be.\n3.  **Evaluate Purchasing Power:** Ensure the target market has the financial resources to afford your solution.

Make sure\nyour targets have the money, or access to the amount of money, needed to buy your services at the prices you require to make it\nworth your time.\n3) Easy to Target\nLet’s say you have a perfect market, but no way of finding the people who comprise it. Well, making a Grand Slam Offer\nwill be difficult. I make my life easier by looking for easy-to-target markets. Examples of this are avatars that have\nassociations they belong to, mailing lists, social media groups, channels they all watch, etc. If our potential customers are all\ngathered together somewhere, then we can market to them. If searching them out, however, is like finding needles in a haystack,\nthen it can be very difficult to get your offer in front of any potentially interested eyes.\nThis point is tactical. It is reality, not theoretical. For instance, you may \nwant\n to serve rich doctors. But if your ads are\nbeing displayed to nursing students, your offer will fall on deaf ears, no matter how good it is. Main point: you want to make\nsure you can target your ideal audience easily. \n(Clarifying point - there is no issue wanting to serve rich doctors, they are\neasy to\n \nfind. This is just illustrative that your promotions must be served to the right audience).\n4) Growing\nGrowing markets are like a tailwind. They make everything move forward faster. Declining markers are like headwinds.\nThey make all efforts harder. This was Lloyd's example. Newspapers had three of the four makings of a great market: (1) lots\nof pain, (2) purchasing power, (3) easy to target. But they were shrinking (fast).

No matter how hard he tried, the entire\nmarketplace was fighting against him. Business is hard enough, and markets move quickly. So you might as well find a good\nmarket to give you a tailwind to make the process easier.\nMaking This Real\nThere are three main markets that will always exist: Health, Wealth, and Relationships. The reason that those will always\nexist is that there is always tremendous pain when you lack them. There is always demand for solutions to these core human\npains. The goal is to find a smaller subgroup within one of those larger buckets that is growing, has the buying power, and is\neasy to target (the other three variables).\nSo if I were a relationship expert trying to find my avatar, I’d rather focus on “second half of life relationship” coaching for\nold timers than helping college students in relationships. Why? Because senior citizens who are alone are likely suffering more\npain as they are nearer their deaths (pain), have more buying power (money), and are easy to find (targeting). Lastly, at the time\nof this writing, there are more people turning 65 each year than turning 20 (growing).\nThat is the idea. Think about what you are good at in regards to health, wealth, and relationships. Then think about who\nmight value your service the most (is in the most pain), has the buying power to pay what \nyou\n want (money), and can be found\neasily (targeting). As long as those three criteria are strong \nand\n the market isn't shrinking, you’ll be in good shape.\nBut how important to your success is finding a “great market” versus a “normal market” versus a “bad market?” The\nanswer: it actually depends.

Let me explain.\nOrder of Importance: Three Levers on Success\nIt’s unlikely you are going to be in a dying market like the newspaper example. It’s also unlikely you’re going to be selling\ntoilet paper in COVID (buying frenzy). You’ll likely be in a “normal” market. And that’s totally okay. There is a fortune to be\nmade within normal markets. My single point here is that you can't be in a “bad” market, or nothing will work. That being said,\nhere’s the simplest illustration of the order of importance between markets, offers, and persuasion skills:\nStarving Crowd (market) > Offer Strength > Persuasion Skills\nLet’s say you were to rate these elements on a scale of great, normal, and bad. You could essentially move down the line\nfrom left to right in order of importance. A “great” rating on a higher-order piece overpowers anything else lower on the\npriority scale. A “normal” rating moves the buck to the next part of the equation. A “bad” stops the equation \nunless\n a “great”\nfrom a higher priority component nullifies it. Here are a few examples:\nExample #1:\n Even if you have a bad offer and are bad at persuasion, you’re going to make money if you’re in a great\nmarket. If you’re on the corner hocking hot dogs when the bars close up at 2am, with mobs of starving drunk folks, you’re\ngonna sell out your hotdogs.\nExample #2 (most of us):\n If you are in a normal market and have a Grand Slam Offer (great), you can make tons of money\neven if you’re bad at persuasion.

In order to be massively successful, you would\nhave\n to be \nexceptionally\n good at persuasion. Then and only then will you succeed, with your persuasive skills serving as the\nfulcrum of your success. Heck, many empires have been built by exceptional persuaders. It’s just the hardest path to follow and\nrequires the most effort and learning. Nailing your offer helps you shortcut this path to success. Otherwise, you will just have a\nnormal business that takes exceptional skill to be successful (nothing wrong with that, but probably not what you signed up for).\nCommit to the Niche\nI have a saying when coaching entrepreneurs on picking their target market \n“Don’t make\n \nme niche slap you.”\nToo often, a newer entrepreneur half-heartedly tries \none\n offer in \none\n market, doesn't make a million dollars, then\nmistakenly thinks “this is a bad market.” Most times that’s not actually the case. They just haven’t found a Grand Slam Offer yet\nto apply to that market.\nThey think, \nI’ll switch from helping dentists to helping chiropractors\n — \nthat’s it!\n When, in reality, both of those are\nnormal markets and represent billions of dollars in revenue. Either would work, j\nust not both\n. You must pick \none\n. No one can\nserve two masters.\nI have coined the term “niche slap” to remind entrepreneurs in my communities to commit once they pick. All businesses\nand, all markets, have unpleasant characteristics. The grass is never greener once you get to the other side. If you keep hopping\nfrom niche to niche, hoping that the market will solve your problems, you deserve to be \nniche slapped.\nYou must stick with whatever you pick long enough to have trial and error. You will fail. In fact, you will fail until you\nsucceed.

So, pick then commit.\nRiches Are In The Niches\nThe other reason to commit to the niche is because of how much more you will make.\nSimply put, niching down will make you far more money.\nAuthor Note - When To Broaden (Advice For Most People)\nFor most, if you are under $10M per year, niching down will make you more money. After that, it will depend on how narrow the niche is, or, what is\ncalled TAM (total addressable market). A business can really only grow to meet the total addressable market. That being said, for most people, getting to\n$10M per year is already a top .4% achievement (only 1 in 250 businesses achieve this). So for 99.6 percent of readers below $10M per year, it’s almost\nalways easier to serve \nfewer\n clients \nmore narrowly\n. But if you want to go beyond that, you\n \nmay\n \n(depending on the size of\n \nyour TAM) have to broaden\nyour audience by going up market, down market, or into an adjacent market where your existing services can provide value.\nFor context, many companies expanded to $30M+ per year serving a single niche: Chiropractors, Gyms, Plumbers, Solar, Roofers, Salon Owners, etc. If\nyou are at $1M or $3M, thinking you have capped and must expand, you are wrong. You just need to be better.\nWhen I truly grasped how much more \nprofit\n I was leaving on the table, it changed my life. It was what took me from doing\nacquisition for \nanyone\n to teaching it to a specific avatar. In my instance, I decided on a microgym owner with ~100 members, a\nsigned lease, at least one employee, and wanted to help clients lose weight. That’s pretty specific compared to “small business", "output": "## Frameworks\n\n*   **Niche Commitment:** The core principle is committing to a specific niche and avoiding constant audience shifts.\n*   **TAM (Total Addressable Market) Limitation:** Businesses are limited by the size of their TAM.\n\n## Key Ideas / Steps\n\n*   **Start Niche:** Begin with a very specific niche.\n*   **Profit Maximization:** Focusing on a niche significantly increases profit potential.\n*   **Avoid \"Capped\" Thinking:** Don't assume growth is limited; it’s often about optimizing within a niche.\n*   **Iteration:** “You just need to be better.” (Continuous improvement within the niche is key.)\n\n## Q&A (Implied/Stated)\n\n*   **Question:** \"When is it okay to broaden your audience?\"\n    *   **Answer:**  For most businesses under $10M per year, niching down is the better path. After that, TAM becomes a key consideration, and expansion might be necessary.\n*   **Question:** \"What's the difference between a niche and a broad audience?\"\n    *   **Answer:**  A niche involves serving fewer clients more narrowly, while a broad audience is less targeted and often leaves money on the table.\n\n## Case Examples / Stories\n\n*   **Examples of Successful Niche Expansion:** Chiropractors, Gyms, Plumbers, Solar, Roofers, Salon Owners – these businesses successfully expanded to $30M+ by focusing on a single niche.\n*   **Personal Example:** Alex Hormozi shifted from “doing acquisition for anyone” to teaching acquisition to a specific avatar: microgym owners.\n\n## Copywriting Formulas\n\n*   **Implicit AIDA:** The content encourages a focused message (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) tailored to a specific micro-niche.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide: Niche Down for Maximum Profit\n\n1.  **Identify a Micro-Niche:** Start with a hyper-specific industry or customer segment. Consider factors like size, pain points, and opportunities.\n2.  **Commit to the Niche:** Once you’ve chosen a niche, fully commit to serving it. Don’t jump to different audiences.\n3.  **Understand Your Avatar:** Deeply research your target audience within the niche - their challenges, desires, and buying behaviors.\n4.  **Optimize Your Offering:** Tailor your products or services to precisely meet the needs of this specific niche.\n5.  **Refine Your Messaging:** Craft marketing messages that resonate directly with your ideal customer within the niche.\n6.  **Continuous Improvement:**  Don’t view this as a “one and done” process.

Your niche matters. And if you can sell the same product for 100x the price, should you?\nI’ll let you decide.\nSummary Points\nThe purpose of this chapter is to reinforce two things. First, don't pick a \nbad\n market. Normal markets are fine. Great\nmarkets are great. Second, once you pick, commit to it until you figure it out.\nIf you try \none hundred offers\n, \nI promise\n you will succeed. Most people never try anything. Others fail once, then give up. It\ntakes resilience to succeed. Stop personalizing! It’s not about you! If your offer doesn’t work, it doesn’t mean you suck. It\nmeans your offer sucks. Big difference. You only suck if you stop trying. So, try again. You’ll never become world class if you\nstop after a failed attempt.\nIf you find a crazy good market, ride it, and ride it hard. And if you pair a Grand Slam Offer with a crazy market, you’ll\nlikely never need to work again (seriously). So have this skill set — the ability to accurately assess markets by taking into\naccount pain, money, targeting, and growth — in your back pocket so that when lightning strikes, you can make sure it strikes\ntwice.\nHaving established how to nail a market, let’s get back to pricing.

Enjoy.\nWhy You Should Charge So Much It Hurts\nMost business owners are \nnot\n competing on price or value. In fact, they’re not actually competing on anything at all. Their\npricing process typically goes something like this:\n1\n. \nLook at marketplace\n2\n. \nSee what everyone else offers\n3\n. \nTake the average\n4\n. \nGo slightly below to remain “competitive”\n5\n. \nProvide what their competitors offers with a “little more”\n6\n. \nEnd up at a value proposition of “more for less”\nAnd the big secret: those competitors they are copying are dead broke. \nSo why on earth\n \ncopy them?\nPricing where the market is means you’re pricing for market \nefficiency\n. Over time, in an efficient marketplace, more\ncompetitors enter offering “a little more for a little less,” until eventually no one can provide any more for any less. At this\npoint, a market reaches perfect efficiency, and the business owners participating make \njust enough\n at the end of the month to\nkeep going. The bottom 10-20 percent of operators get washed out or lose the will to fight. Then fresh business owners enter\nwith no idea and repeat the process of their forefathers. And around and around they go.\nIn plain words, pricing this way means you are providing a service at just above what it costs for you to stay above water.\nWe are \nnot\n trying to stay barely above water. We are trying to make egregious amounts of money that will have your relatives\nasking if what you are doing is legal. Again, we are not trying to get the most customers. \nWe are trying to make\n \nthe most money\n.\nThat being said, since there is no strategic benefit to being the second-lowest priced player in your marketplace.

Yet, the tasters reported\na wide discrepancy between the “high priced” wine and the “cheap” wine. This has deep implications for the direct\nrelationship between value and price.\nIn essence, raising your prices can directly enhance the value you provide.

Frameworks**\n\n*   **The “Stupid” Offer Framework:** The core concept is that a truly compelling offer makes the prospect feel *so* good, they feel foolish saying no. This is achieved by offering disproportionate value compared to the price.\n*   **The \"Wrong-Way\" Pricing Model:**  Instead of pricing based on what *you* think it's worth, price it based on what the *customer* thinks it's worth. Alex argues this is the only way to truly create a “stupid” offer.\n\n\n\n**II. Bullet Points for Key Ideas or Steps**\n\n*   **Focus on Perception of Value:** The most effective offers aren't about what you *give*, but what the customer *perceives* they're receiving.\n*   **Create a \"Loss Aversion\" Situation:**  People are more motivated to avoid a loss than to gain something of equal value. Frame the offer in terms of what they’ll *lose* if they don’t take it.\n*   **Offer an Outcome, Not Just a Product:**  People buy *outcomes*. Don’t sell a widget; sell the results the widget enables.\n*   **Leverage Social Proof:**  People are influenced by what others are doing.  Showcase testimonials, case studies, and social proof to reinforce the value proposition.\n*   **Limited-Time Offers & Scarcity:**  Scarcity increases perceived value and urgency.\n\n\n**III. Q&A (Implied or Stated Questions with Answers)**\n\n*   **Q: “How do I know if my offer is good enough?”** A:  \"If people are actively resisting saying no, it’s likely not ‘stupid’ enough. You’re looking for that visceral reaction of, 'I can't afford to *not* take this.'\"\n*   **Q: “What if my product isn’t inherently amazing?”** A: “It doesn’t matter. You’re not selling the product; you’re selling the transformation.  A bad product, packaged with the right perceived value, can still create a ‘stupid’ offer.\"\n\n\n\n**IV. Case Examples or Stories**\n\n*   **The Rolex Story (Implied):**  The narrative often alludes to the high price of Rolex watches.  The perceived value – status, luxury, exclusivity – far exceeds the actual cost of materials and manufacturing. The \"stupid\" offer is buying a Rolex, even knowing the cost, because the perceived value is so high.\n\n\n\n\n**V. Copywriting Formulas**\n\n*   **AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action):** This framework is implicitly being utilized. The goal is to initially grab attention, build interest in the offer’s benefits, stimulate desire, and then prompt the customer to take action.\n*   **PAS (Problem, Agitation, Solution):** Alex's content strongly utilizes PAS. Identifying the customer’s problem, amplifying that pain (agitation), and then presenting the offer as the solution.\n\n\n\n**VI. High-Level Topics**\n\n*   **Psychology:** The core of this content is deeply rooted in behavioral psychology (loss aversion, perceived value).\n*   **Marketing:** Specifically, this focuses on offer design and value proposition.\n*   **Sales:** Ultimately, this informs how to create sales offers that convert.\n\n\n\n**VII.

I'm talking heinous amounts of money. That being said, anyone can raise their prices, but only a select few can\ncharge these rates \nand get people to say yes\n.\nFrom this point forward, you must abandon any notion you have about “what's fair.” Every enormous company in the world\ncharges you money for things that cost them nothing. It costs pennies for the phone company to add an additional user, except\nthey don’t mind charging you hundreds per month for access. It costs pennies to manufacture pharmaceutical drugs, but they\ndon’t mind charging hundreds of dollars a month for it. Media companies charge advertisers a king’s ransom for your eyeballs,\nand it costs them next to nothing to get you to like kitten photos on social media. You \nneed\n to have a big discrepancy between\nwhat something costs you and what you charge for it. It is the only way to be unreasonably successful.\nMany entrepreneurs believe that charging “too much” is bad. The reality is that, yes, you should never charge more than\nyour product is \nworth\n. But you should charge \nfar\n more for your product and services than it costs to fulfill it. Think up to a\nhundred times more, not just two or three times more. And if you provide enough \nvalue\n, it should still always be a \nsteal \nfor the\nprospect. That is the power of value. It unleashes unlimited pricing and profit\n \npower to scale your company.\nFor example, one of my private clients (whose company I have equity in) is in the photography space. Over two years,\nimplementing the tactics outlined in this book, the owner was able to increase the average ticket from $300 to $1,500. That’s a\n5x increase (gasp).

If you\ncan make the bottom part of the equation equal to zero, you’re golden.

It’s not about how much you increase your prospect’s likelihood of success, or decrease the time\ndelay to achievement, or decrease their effort and sacrifice. That in itself is \nnot\n valuable. Many times, they will have no idea.\nThe Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect \nperceives\n the increase in likelihood of achievement, \nperceives\nthe decrease in time delay, and\n perceives \nthe decrease in effort and sacrifice.\nA prime example of this happened in the London tunnel system. The biggest increase in rider satisfaction (\naka value\n) was\nnever from faster trains to decrease wait times. Instead, it was from a simple dotted map that showed them when the next train\nwas coming and how long they had to wait. The dotted map, which only cost a few million dollars, decreased the riders’\nperception\n of time delay and sacrifice (being bored waiting) more than actually making the trains faster (which costs billions\nof dollars to do).

The more-experienced surgeon has a track record of achieving a result, which\nincentivizes their desirability.\nPeople value this perceived likelihood of achievement.

The shorter the distance between when\nthey purchase and they receive value/the outcome, the more valuable your services or product is.\nThere are two elements to this driver of value: Long-term outcome and short-term experience. Many times, there are short-\nterm experiences that occur while en route to the long-term outcomes. They happen “along the way” and provide value.\nIt’s good to understand both. The thing people \nbuy\n is the long-term value, aka their “dream outcome.” But the thing that\nmakes them \nstay\n long enough to get it is the short-term experience.

Be creative. They just need to know they are on the right path and that they made\nthe right decision trusting you and your business.\nLet me give you another example. If I sell someone a bikini body, their time delay to realize that outcome may be 12 months\nor even longer. Along the way, though, as they change their bodies, they may experience higher sex drive, more energy, and an\nincreased community of friends.\nThey aren’t \ninitially\n buying those things, but those things may become short-term benefits that keep them in the game long\nenough to achieve their ultimate outcome. They buy the dream, but they stay for the benefits they discover along the way. The\nfaster and more clearly you can demonstrate those benefits, the more valuable your service will be. For a weight loss customer,\nwe would get them to meet someone else so they immediately had some social benefits from the program, \nand\n we usually gave\nthem a more aggressive diet in the beginning. Why? Because we wanted them to have a big, fast emotional win, so we could\nget them to commit to the long term. This is also backed by science. People who experience a victory early on are more likely\nto continue with something than those who do not.\nThat being said, having to wait 12 to 24 months to get what you want is a \nlong\n time when you can do liposuction and be\ndone in an afternoon.

Many companies have entered free spaces and done exceedingly well with a\n“speed first” strategy. A few notable examples: The MVD vs DMV wait in line forever or pay $50 you can skip the line and get your license renewed\nprivately. Fedex vs USPS (when it absolutely positively has to be there overnight). Spotify vs Slow Free Music. Uber vs Walking. Fast beats free.

I wanted so deeply to be successful, prove my dad wrong about my decision to start\nmy own business, and prove to myself that I was worth something. But try as I did, I couldn't even sell people into a\n$99/mo bootcamp. People would say, “LA Fitness is $29/mo. This is expensive.” I even tried getting people to start for free.\nThey said they wouldn't bother because $99/mo afterwards was still too much, and they didn't want to start something they\nwouldn't continue with.\nIt’s a new level of frustration when you can’t even give your services away for free to people. I felt worthless, and I didn't\nknow what to do. Thankfully, during this time, I was in groups with other gym owners, and I started hearing about marketers\nand books. I devoured everything I could. And as soon as I stumbled on Dan Kennedy’s books, I was hooked.\nIn his books, he talked about making “irresistible offers.” Again, this theme of “making an offer so good people would feel\nstupid to say no” kept re-appearing.

When listing out problems,\nthink about what happens immediately before and immediately after someone uses your product/service. What's the “next” thing\nthey need help with? These are all the problems. Think about it in insane detail. If you do, you will create a more valuable and\ncompelling offer as you’ll continually be answering people’s next problem as it manifests..\nSo, let’s go ahead and list out the problems from a prospect’s perspective as you think about them. What points of friction\nexist for them? I like to think in the sequence that the customer will experience each of these obstacles. Again, channel insane\ndetail (the more problems the better!).\nExample Problem List: Weight Loss\nFirst thing they must do: Buying healthy food, grocery shopping\n1\n. \nBuying healthy food is hard, confusing, and I won’t like it\n2\n. \nBuying healthy food will take too much time\n3\n. \nBuying healthy food is expensive\n4\n. \nI will not be able to cook healthy food forever.

Cut!”\nFRIENDS TO RACHEL GREEN IN FRIENDS\ndivided this chapter into two parts because it’s the meatiest section in the book. It’s also the most important. Without a\nvaluable product or service, the rest of the book won’t be as actionable\n.\n We just covered all the problems we are going to\nsolve. The second half of making your offer is breaking down tactically what we are going to do/provide for our client. In\ntheory, we’d all love to fly out and live with our customers to fix their problems. In reality, that wouldn’t make a very scalable\nbusiness. We need our offer to be incredibly attractive \nand\n profitable.\nThat being said, if this is your first Grand Slam Offer, it’s important to over-deliver like crazy. Maybe flying out isn’t such\na bad idea in the beginning. Make some sales, then think about how to make it easier for your clients. You want them to think to\nthemselves, “I get all this, for only that?” In essence, you want them to perceive \ntremendous value\n.\nEveryone buys bargains. Some people just buy $100,000 things for only $10,000. That’s where we want to live: high\nprices, but a \nsteal\n for the value (like hopefully this book so far).\nSales to Fulfillment Continuum\nIn order to best absorb the notions of trimming and stacking, we need a mental reframe.\nEnter the sales to fulfillment continuum.\nWhenever you are building a business, you have a continuum between ease of fulfillment and ease of sales. If you lower\nwhat you have to do, it increases how hard your product or service is to sell. If you do as much as possible, it makes your\nproduct or service easy to sell but hard to fulfill because there’s more demand on your time investment. The trick, and the\nultimate goal, is to find a sweet spot where you sell something very well that’s also easy to fulfill.\nI have always lived by the mantra, “Create flow. Monetize flow. Then add friction.” This means I generate demand \nfirst\n.", "output": "## 100m Offers - Value Offer: Creating Your Grand Slam Offer Part II: Trim & Stack\n\n**1.

Monetize flow. Then add friction.” This means I generate demand \nfirst\n.\nThen, with my offer, I get them to say yes. Once I have people saying yes, then, and only then, will I add friction in my\nmarketing, or decide to offer \nless\n for the same price.\nPracticality drives this practice. If you can’t get demand flowing in, then you have no idea whether what you have is good.\nI’d rather do more for every customer and have cash flow coming in, then optimize my business but have zero cash flow\ncoming in after (and zero idea about what I need to adjust to better serve my customers).\nHere’s a perfect example to drive this home. When I started Gym Launch, gym owners reached out asking me to help. They\nneeded so much help, I didn’t know where to start. But I wanted to make sure they got way more than they paid me. So here’s\nwhat I ended up doing to fill their gyms: I would fly out to their gym for 21 days, spend my own money on hotels, car rentals,\neating out, advertising, generate the leads, work the leads, then sell for them. I would even do the first onboarding meeting with\nclients to get them started. In short, I did \neverything\n. I took on all the risk.\nThey only had to put down $500 to “reserve” their date, which I made refundable at the end of their launch. So they had 0\nfinancial risk, 0 time risk, 0 effort, and the deal was, I got to keep all the up front cash collected from selling their services, and\nthey got clients for free. You can imagine how this was a pretty compelling offer.\nOn my own, I was able to sell about $100,000/mo in up front cash for myself. So these deals were very lucrative for me.\nOver time, I scaled that to a team of 8 guys selling every month. But this began to wear on me and the team. It was at that point", "output": "## Frameworks\n\n*   “Create flow. Monetize flow.

He provided onboarding meetings and handled all the risk for $500 upfront with a refundable date. This generated $100,000/mo in upfront cash.\n\n\n\n## Copywriting Formulas\n\n*   **PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution):** The initial approach – identifying a problem, amplifying the pain, and offering a solution (evident in the Gym Launch example).\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide (Based on Alex Hormozi’s Framework)\n\n1.  **Generate Demand:** Focus intensely on creating a high volume of demand for your product or service *before* launching a formal offer. This can involve content marketing, prospecting, early-bird list building, etc.\n2.  **Offer Extreme Value:**  Create an offer that provides significantly more value than the initial price point.  This builds trust and creates a compelling reason to say “yes.”\n3.  **Minimize Friction:**  Keep your initial marketing materials and sales process as frictionless as possible.  Focus on ease of purchase and minimal required effort.\n4.  **Take On Initial Risk:**  Initially, personally handle the fulfillment of the offer, taking on the risk of potential failure. This demonstrates your confidence and commitment.\n5.  **Validate & Scale:** As demand is established, use the data and feedback to optimize and scale your operation – but only *after* you’ve proven the underlying concept.", "metadata": {"source": "Alex Hormozi 100m Offers"}}

As a result, I lost many sales.\nOne month I really needed to make some sales to pay rent. My next sale walked in the door - it was a business exec looking to lose weight.

I was a stickler for making people \nnot\n eat out. But I really \nneeded\n the money. Refusing to lose the sale because of this \none thing\n, I conceded “I’ll\nmake you an eating out guide for when you go to restaurants so you can eat our 100 percent of the time and still hit your goal. How does that sound?” She\nagreed, and I closed the sale.\nI took the time to make an eating out guide for her. But from that point going forward, whenever someone said “but what about eating out??” I had the\nsolution. Over time, I continued solving obstacles with templates and trainings until there were no more “\none things”\n to prevent my sales. This lesson has\nstuck with me to this day.

Frameworks:**\n\n*   **The “Deal Structuring” Framework:** The core of Hormozi’s approach, focused on layering offers to increase perceived value.\n*   **The \"Big Offer\" Concept:** Starting with a high-value offer and then layering on smaller, enticing offers.\n\n\n**III. Bullet Points for Key Ideas/Steps:**\n\n*   **Layering Offers:** The most critical concept – create multiple offers that build on each other.  Start with the “Big Offer” and then build a “Small Offer” and a “Bonus Offer.”\n*   **Small Offer:**  A lower-priced option designed to make people feel like they’re getting a deal.  It’s about creating perceived value.\n*   **Bonus Offer:** A ‘nice to have’ that adds to the value, often free or very low cost.\n*   **Scarcity & Urgency:**  Create a sense of \"fear of missing out\" (FOMO) by limiting quantity or time.\n*   **Guarantees:** Reduce risk for the customer.  Extended warranties, money-back guarantees, etc.\n*   **Naming:**  A powerful tool for commanding attention and establishing a dominant position.\n\n\n**IV. Copywriting Formulas:**\n\n*   **AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action):**  A fundamental formula applied to structuring your offer and messaging.\n*   **PAS (Problem, Agitation, Solution):** Used to initially frame the offer around a painful problem.\n\n**V. Case Examples/Stories:**\n\n*   **The “X Days Only” Example:**  Hormozi repeatedly emphasizes the effectiveness of limited-time offers.  He illustrates this with the idea of a “3-day Blitz” where prices are dramatically reduced.  This creates immense urgency.\n*   **The \"Discounted Membership\" Example:** He describes how creating a tiered membership structure – with a high-priced “VIP” option and lower-priced, “regular” tiers – effectively leverages scarcity and gives people options.\n\n**VI. Q&A (Implied/Stated):**\n\n*   **Question:** *“How do I make my offer feel more valuable?”*\n    *   **Answer (Implied):** By layering offers and strategically using scarcity, urgency, and guarantees. The more options, the more perceived value.\n*   **Question:** *“What if my audience doesn’t care about scarcity?”*\n    *   **Answer (Implied):** Scarcity *will* work if implemented correctly. If you create a genuine sense of limited availability, it will compel action.\n\n\n**VII. Step-by-Step Guide: Building a Powerful Offer (Based on Hormozi's Framework)**\n\n1.  **Define Your \"Big Offer\":** This is your core product or service – the foundation of your offer. It should be the most valuable thing you’re selling.\n2.  **Create a \"Small Offer\":**  Design a lower-priced product or service that seems like a bargain.  It shouldn’t be a completely separate product but rather a smaller, complementary piece of your core offering.\n3.  **Develop a \"Bonus Offer\":** A small, inexpensive item that adds perceived value. Think a digital guide, checklist, or exclusive content.\n4.  **Layer in Scarcity:**  Limit the quantity of your offer (e.g., “Only 50 spots available”). Or, create urgency with a limited-time offer (\"3-day Blitz”).\n5.  **Add a Guarantee:**  Provide a money-back guarantee to eliminate risk. This is crucial for building trust.\n6.  **Craft Your Messaging:**  Use copywriting frameworks (AIDA, PAS) to highlight the benefits of *all* layers of your offer. Focus on the problems your offer solves and the results people can achieve.\n7.  **Test & Refine:** Continuously track the performance of your offer and make adjustments based on the data.

It was like straight out of a movie.\nThe driver rolled down the window. “Name?” “Alex and Leila Hormozi.”\nHe scanned the list on his clipboard, nodded, then checked off our names. “Great,” he said. His demeanor transformed from\nstern to inviting. “Welcome to the fundraiser. Stay in this line. You’ll make a left, then security will escort you the rest of the\nway.”\nThe security guard talked into his walkie talkie to the next post down the road, signaling our car was approved.\nPulling up to the front of the estate was like entering into a Bond movie. Lamborghinis, Bugattis, Ferraris, and brands of\ncars that are too expensive to even speak of. Old guys with young, scantily-clad girls. A-List Actors. Celebrities with millions\nof followers who were recording themselves as they arrived, talking through their iphones to their audiences. And us.\nThe fundraiser was $25,000 per ticket to attend, with an invite list of only 100. There was a red carpet and all. Every year,\nthe fundraiser culminated in a big auction for memorabilia and items some of the business owners in the audience gave away\nfor charity.\nWe walked around looking at the entertainment stations purposely devised to get donors in the “giving mood.” We saw\n$10,000 scotches . . . $500 cigars . . . pre-released items from major brands that wouldn’t be available to the public until\nmonths later.

We artificially increase the demand for our\nproducts and services through some sort of persuasive communication. When we increase the demand, we can sell more units.\nWhen we decrease supply, we can sell those units for more money. The “perfect profit combination” is lots of demand, and\nvery little supply, or \nperceived\n supply. The process of enhancing your core offer is designed to do both of these things:\nincrease demand and decrease \nperceived\n supply so that you can sell the \nsame\n products for \nmore\n money than you otherwise\ncould, and in \nhigher\n volumes than you otherwise would (over a longer time horizon).\nAuthor Note:\nThis assumes a regular business who is not trying to gain mass market penetration for some other strategic advantage.\nDesire comes from \nnot\n getting what you want. In fact, I heard this quote that I love from Naval Ravikant: “Desire is a\ncontract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.” It follows, therefore, that we only want things we\ndo \nnot\n have. As soon as we have them, our desire for them disappears. Therefore, if we seek to increase the demand (or\ndesire), we must decrease or \ndelay\n satisfying the desires of our prospects.

Let\nthat sit with you for a second.\nConsider this example. We promote some two-day workshop that is upcoming. First we whisper that it’s coming. Then we\ntease it with some of the benefits. Then we shout that it is launching in a week. Then, when we launch this amazing workshop.\nWe have two supply-demand scenarios:\nScenario one:\n We sell 10 units at $500 each (sell entire pyramid at price all say yes)\nScenario two:\n We sell two one-day workshops 1-on-1 for $5000 each.

Instead, I’ve found demand to be fractal (80/20). In other words, one fifth of the prospects are willing to pay five\ntimes the price (or more).\nIn the example, I might have ten people willing to pay $500, but two of them willing to pay $5000.

Let’s attack some real-world, in-the-trenches strategies to \nreliably\n create scarcity .\nCreating Scarcity\nWhen there’s a fixed supply or quantity of products or services that are available for purchase it creates “scarcity” or a\n“fear of missing out.” It increases the need to take action, and by extension, purchase your offer. This is where you publicly\nshare that you are only giving away X amount of products or can only handle Y new clients.\nFor example, if a musician drops a limited edition hoodie and says he only made 100 and they will never be made again,\nare you more or less likely to buy it than one that is always available? More likely, naturally. The idea that you can \nnever\n get it\nagain makes it more desirable.\nThis is an example of scarcity. It is the fear of missing out on something. It pulls on our psychological fear of loss to get us\nto take action. Humans are far more motivated to take action to hoard a scarce resource than they are to act on something that\ncould \nhelp\n them. \nFear of loss \nis stronger than\n desire for gain\n. We will wield this psychological lever to get your\n \nclients to buy\nin a frenzy, all at once, until you are \nsold out\n.\nThree Types of Scarcity\n1\n. \nLimited Supply of Seats/Slots: in general or over X period of time.\n2\n. \nLimited Supply of Bonuses\n3\n. \nNever available again.\nBut how do you use this properly without being phony? I’ll try and give you some real world examples\nPhysical Products\nHaving limited releases is a tried and true method of using this psychological bias to your advantage. You can have limited\nreleases for flavors, colors, designs, sizes, etc. “This month, we are releasing 100 boxes of mint chocolate cookie flavored\nprotein bars.” Important point: to properly utilize this method you \nshould\n \nalways\n \nsell out.", "output": "## Frameworks\n\n*   **Scarcity Creation:** Leveraging fixed supply or limited quantities to trigger \"fear of missing out\" (FOMO).\n*   **Fear of Loss:** Utilizing the psychological principle that the fear of losing something is stronger than the desire for gain.\n\n## Key Ideas/Steps\n\n*   **Identify Fixed Supply:** Determine a finite quantity of a product or service.\n*   **Publicly Announce Scarcity:** Clearly communicate the limited availability to your audience.\n*   **Capitalize on FOMO:** Drive urgency and desire for immediate purchase.\n*   **Sell Out:**  Implement scarcity successfully by ensuring you reach sell-out status.\n\n## Q&A (Implied/Stated)\n\n*   **Question:** “How are you going to show me how to use scarcity to increase the amount of people who want my offer when currently no one does?”\n    *   **Answer:** By creating a fixed supply and publicly announcing it, triggering the fear of missing out.\n\n## Case Examples/Stories\n\n*   **Musician & Limited Edition Hoodie:** A musician releasing a limited edition hoodie (100 units) – “are you more or less likely to buy it than one that is always available?” (More likely, due to the limited availability).\n*   **Flavor/Design Releases:**  Example: “This month, we are releasing 100 boxes of mint chocolate cookie flavored protein bars.”\n\n## Copywriting Formulas\n\n*   **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):**  The core concept – creating a sense of urgency and scarcity.\n\n\n## High-Level Topics\n\n*   **Marketing Psychology**\n*   **Sales & Conversion**\n*   **Product Launch**", "metadata": {"source": "Alex Hormozi 100m Offers"}}

This is one of the shortcuts of the new rich.”\nby Robert Kiyosaki\nYou have something special inside you. Something you know. Something you do. Something you can\nteach. You are already an expert. We all have this something special inside of us and, if we use it\nright, we can change the world—and become rich in the process.\nInformation is a powerful tool. It can be used to attract interest, increase desire, demand\nattention, and sell. But information alone isn’t enough. It’s the skillful application of the right\ninformation at the right time that can change your life.\nIf you aren’t familiar with my work, I teach a system called the Cashflow Quadrant. I explain\nthat you are in one of four places in your work life. You’re either an employee (E), you’re self-\nemployed (S), you own a business (B), or you’re an investor (I). Most of us start out as E, and some\nnever leave this stage. To become financially free, though, you must move through the quadrants and\nget to the business and investor stages as quickly as possible.\nInformation is how that’s done. Information that’s already inside you. Think about it. What do\nyou know? What can you teach others?\nMy Rich Dad Company is essentially an expert business. I offer financial education through a\nvariety of products, programs, courses, and mentorships. It started with \nCASHFLOW\n, a simple game\nthat transforms lives with the lessons it teaches. Then we expanded into lectures and books and\ncoaching platforms. My information business grew organically. I didn’t have a step-by-step plan.\nThanks to this book, you do.\nIn \nExpert Secrets\n, Russell Brunson has masterfully laid out the steps to becoming a thought\nleader and building a following of people who will pay you for your information.

For months leading up to spring break, I had been\nstudying marketing and learning how to sell things online. At that point, almost everything I tried\nfailed.

While they did spend money \nto acquire your email address, they could then market to you forever without it costing them a penny. Pretty soon, their email lists started growing, first with tens of people, then thousands, then tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands, and finally, millions of people they could market to from that point on for free. As you can imagine, that email list would be pretty valuable to the marketer, and as you learn to grow your own email list through this book, it will become very valuable to you as well.\nPop-up ads were huge back then, and many advertising agencies sold packages such as, “Have your \npop up show up 18 million times for $50!” Okay, so maybe that’s an exaggeration, but I should know… I was one of those marketers that would buy those packages and have my ads show up on your computer. I joined this game right when pop ups were getting huge and I started building a huge email list. For me, pop ups were the lifeblood of my business. \nPretty soon, though, the pop-up world went out of control. It wasn’t just one ad that would pop up; you’d \nusually get 14 ads that would pop up all at once, and of course that was super annoying for consumers. Sometimes you’d go to a site and your computer would just crash because it couldn’t handle all the pop ups. That’s when pop-up blockers were invented. All of a sudden, my business (and a bunch of other marketers’ businesses) pretty much disappeared overnight because my pop-up ads weren’t being seen anymore.

These marketers \nsuggested, “What if instead of having someone come to a website where an ad would pop up, what if we made the pop up the actual page? It would act as a gateway, and it would force people to put in their email address to actually see what they wanted to see. It would literally ‘squeeze’ the email right out of them!”\nAnd while this will probably age me, I still remember those early marketing debates. Other marketers \nresponded to the idea by saying, “Why would you do that? Y ou’re blocking people from seeing your website. That’s the dumbest thing in the world!” \nThankfully, a bunch of marketers started testing it. Amazingly, the squeeze page concept worked, and \nit shifted business as we know it. Instead of spending money on pop-up ads, we spent money to drive traffic to our squeeze pages. In essence, we were still paying to obtain email addresses through the squeeze pages, but we were able to continue growing our email lists so we could market to those lists for free forever. \nAs the cost to drive traffic grew, though, we started creating additional steps after the squeeze page to \nrecoup our ad costs. These additional steps are now called a lead funnel, and the term “squeeze page” evolved to “landing page. ” \nLEAD FUNNELS\nAt its foundation, a lead funnel is a funnel that generates leads, but it does so much more than that. It not only attracts leads, but it also builds trust, grows a list of leads and customers, builds relationships with your list, converts leads into customers, recoups your ad costs, offers your customers additional opportunities to work with you, and ascends customers up your value ladder.

So one of the biggest mistakes we make as entrepreneurs is assuming that everyone moves toward pleasure, and therefore our lead magnets focus on gaining pleasure, rather than escaping pain.

When he created his \nvery first lead magnet, he first wrote his headline, “The 12 Biggest Mistakes Network Marketers Make. ” Then, he wrote an outline of those 12 mistakes, and finally he recorded himself discussing those 12 mistakes. The “mistakes” element of his lead magnet focused on the pain people would feel if they did network marketing wrong, and that lead magnet built him lists of hundreds of thousands of people. \nIt was pretty cool, but what was even cooler came after he gave them the lead magnet. When they \nopted in on his landing page to receive his free “12 Mistakes” video, they went to his thank you page where he invited them to join him on a webinar to learn how to cure those mistakes!

I remember the \nvery first time I understood this principle was when I learned that eBay bought Skype for $2.6 billion. I was shocked, and I thought to myself, “Wait a minute... eBay’s got the best developers in the world. They could literally clone Skype in a weekend if they wanted to.

If you do this poorly (i.e. simply build your email list and don’t build a relationship with the \npeople on it), you will average $1 per month per name on your email list. If you do this well (i.e. build a strong relationship with the people on your list), you can average much more than $1 per month per name. Obviously, these numbers are estimates; there’s no guarantee you’ll make that. But if you follow my training, you should see yourself making at least $1 per month per name, if not even more.\nBut for now, let’s stick with the scenario of making $1 per month \nper name on your list. That means if you get 1,000 people on your list, you should start averaging about $1,000 per month in sales. With 10,000 people, you would make about $10,000 per month, or $120,000 per year. With 100,000 people, you would make about $100,000 per month, or $1.2 million per year, and so on and so on. Remember, those numbers are even if you do it poorly.\nThere’s a direct correlation between the amount you make and the number of people on your email list, \nand these numbers synced in my business as well. I remember when I first got started, somebody told me about this correlation. Sure enough, my very first month I got 217 people on my list and that month I made like $300. I thought to myself, “Weird... ” When I got to 1,000 people, I was making about $1,000 per month. When my list grew to 5,000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, and even 1,500,000 people, my financials synced really close.\nNow for most of you, if you follow what I’m teaching in this book, you should actually average a lot \nmore.

Bullet Points for Key Ideas/Steps:**\n\n*   Build your email list to increase your monthly revenue.\n*   Aim for an average of $1 per month per name on your email list.\n*   Landing pages are the gateway to building your email list.\n*   Focus on building a relationship with your list.\n\n**3. Q&A:**\n\n*   **Implied Question:** “How do I give myself a raise every single day?”\n    *   **Answer:** “Build my email list and build my relationship with it.”\n*   **Implied Question:** “Can I make a significant income with a small email list?”\n    *   **Answer:** “Yes, even with a smaller list, you can average $10-$50+ per month per name, especially if you’re a local business.”\n\n**4. Case Examples/Stories:**\n\n*   The speaker acknowledges the skepticism of local business owners who believe a large email list is unattainable (\"Man, Russell, I live in Boise, Idaho. I’m not going to be able to get 1,000 people on my email list…”)\n\n**5. Copywriting Formulas:**\n\n*   **AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action):** The content implicitly leverages AIDA by encouraging viewers to consider the value of building an email list (Attention), understand the potential revenue (Interest), imagine the financial gain (Desire), and take the action of building a list.\n*   **PAS (Problem, Agitation, Solution):**  The conversation subtly uses PAS. The “problem” is low revenue, the “agitation” is the feeling of being stuck, and the “solution” is building an email list.\n\n**6.

In this business, I always try to ask questions like, “How do I give myself a raise \nevery single day?” And the answer to that question is always the same: build my email list and build my \nrelationship with them. At the end of the day, that’s what it comes down to: serving my people, because they’re all that really matters at the end of the day. And when I go to sell ClickFunnels, that relationship that I built with them will be the most valuable asset I have.\nNow, if you wanted to give yourself $1,000 per month raise in a traditional business, or $10,000 per \nmonth raise, or $100,000 per month raise, there would be a long time period before you could actually get that kind of return. In fact, if you wanted to become a doctor, you’d have to go to college for like 12 years just to qualify for that kind of raise. But in online marketing, we just focus on building a list, because that’s how we’ll give ourselves a raise every day. That is why we’re teaching you about lead funnels. Y our #1 focus should be on growing your email list and developing a relationship with them.\nI laugh thinking of this, but if someone asked me, “What do you want for Christmas?” I would reply, “I \nwant a thousand leads. ” It’s funny because I look at how much money people invest in real estate, and they’ll never get the kind of return I can get from adding more leads into my business. \nFor example, imagine you spent $100,000 for a house that will generate $500 per month in cash flow. \nAfter a year, you would have made $6,000. People do that all day long in real estate, which is great for them, I guess. I can’t buy real estate, though, because I would choose to spend my $100,000 to get 100,000 leads. They’d generate $100,000 per month, which would make me $1.2 million after a year. \nIn other words, my ad spend would produce $100,000 return during the same month that their real", "output": "## Frameworks\n\n*   **Lead Funnels:** The core framework presented is building and utilizing lead funnels.\n*   **Email List as Asset:** The primary framework centers on the email list as a valuable asset for generating revenue and “raises.”\n\n## Key Ideas/Steps\n\n*   **Prioritize List Building:** The #1 focus should be on growing your email list.\n*   **Relationship Building:** Develop a relationship with your list.\n*   **Return on Investment (ROI) Comparison:**  Compare the potential ROI of list building (e.g., 100,000 leads generating $100,000/month) to traditional investments like real estate.\n\n## Q&A\n\n*   **Question:** “How do I give myself a raise every single day?”\n    *   **Answer:** Build your email list and build your relationship with them.\n*   **Question:** “What do you want for Christmas?”\n    *   **Answer:** “I want a thousand leads.”\n\n\n## Case Examples/Stories\n\n*   **Real Estate Comparison:** Contrasts the ROI of investing in real estate (spending $100,000 for $500/month cash flow after a year) with the potential of investing in a lead funnel (spending $100,000 to generate $100,000/month).\n\n## Copywriting Formulas\n\n*   **AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action):** Implicitly, the content aims to capture attention (by posing a question about raises), generate interest in lead funnels, create a desire for increased revenue, and ultimately, drives action (to build a list).\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide: Building a Lead Funnel for Increased Revenue\n\n1.  **Define Your Offer:** What product or service will you be selling to your email list?\n2.  **Build Your Email List:** Implement strategies to attract subscribers – consider offering a free lead magnet, webinar, or other valuable content.\n3.  **Create a Lead Funnel:** Design a sequence of emails and offers that guides subscribers towards a purchase.\n4.  **Track and Optimize:** Monitor your funnel's performance and make adjustments to improve conversion rates.", "metadata": {"source": "Russel Brunson Lead Funnels"}}

It’s so hard for me to justify real estate because I look at those numbers and see that leads are so much more valuable than real estate. I spend the same amount of money I would have spent on a house on leads, and they now pay me every single month. It’s just a better deal. When you look at adding leads to your business as an investment, it’ll change your whole perspective.\nY ou read previously that while building a list is great, in order to make the most money you can with \nyour list, you really have to build the relationship with your list.

For now, let’s move on to the next step of our lead funnel: the thank you page! \nLEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |  13THANK YOU PAGE: Fulfill on Promise to Build Trust\nWhen someone puts in an email address to get your lead magnet, they’re usually \nsuper excited to get it. Y ou promised them something in exchange for their email address, so now they want to receive that value. The worst thing you can do at this point is to do some sort of bait-and-switch where you say, “Buy this product and then I’ll give you what you wanted. ” \nInstead, do exactly what you said you would: give them  the lead magnet. The thank you page serves a \ntwo-fold purpose: deliver the lead magnet (thereby building trust and providing value) and offer your lead something to buy that will help them (thereby recouping your ad cost and building your list).\nThis image shows Brian Moran’s thank you page for his lead magnet: The Going Pro Manifesto.

A list like that doesn’t make you much money. T o fix that, I started my podcast. \nAfter they subscribe, it’s easy to start building that relationship.

Consider potential legal risks.\n3.  **Scale Back:** Select the most appealing bold offer and refine it to a version you *can* confidently deliver.  This version should still be compelling but grounded in reality.\n4.  **Specificity is Crucial:**  Add specific details to the offer to increase its appeal and clarity.

Be specific.\n\n\n## Q&A\n\n*   **Implied Question:** \"What makes a guarantee effective?\"\n    **Answer:** A guarantee based on specific, demonstrable results (e.g., improved sleep, more money) is more effective than a generic ‘satisfaction guaranteed’ offer.\n*   **Implied Question:** “How do I determine what guarantee to create?”\n    **Answer:**  The guarantee should be based on the specific results your product/service delivers and what the customer truly wants.\n\n## Case Examples/Stories\n\n*   The content references \"thousands of scientific split tests\" – indicating the foundation of the guarantee strategy relies on empirical data.\n\n\n## Copywriting Formulas\n\n*   **AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action):** The overall structure advocates for capturing attention, building interest around a specific benefit, creating desire for that benefit, and prompting action.\n*   **PAS (Problem, Agitation, Solution):** The core of the guarantee hinges on identifying the customer’s problem, intensifying their discomfort with that problem, and then presenting your product/service as the solution.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide: Creating a Power Guarantee\n\n1.  **Research Competitor Guarantees:** Conduct a Google search for competitors using the term ‘guarantee’. Call competitors to understand their offers. Analyze the type and specificity of their guarantees.\n2.  **Identify Your Strengths:** Determine what your business excels at – quick results, exceptional craftsmanship, fast installations, consistent quality, etc.\n3.  **Define Customer Desires:**  Understand the specific problems your target customer is trying to solve.  What tangible results do they want?\n4.  **Craft a Specific Promise:** Instead of \"satisfaction guaranteed,\" create a guarantee that aligns with the specific benefit your product/service delivers (e.g., “Get X amount of money in 3 months”).\n5.  **Ensure Customer Experience:**  The guarantee is useless if customers don't achieve the promised outcome.

Frameworks & Key Ideas**\n\n*   **The “Why” Framework:** Suby emphasizes understanding the *reason* behind a prospect’s purchase. He advocates for uncovering the underlying need – is it status, security, family, freedom, or something else? This is the foundation for all his strategies.\n*   **The “Selling” Cycle:**  He breaks this down into four stages: (1) Qualifying, (2) Building Trust, (3)  Offering a Solution, (4) Closing.\n*   **Reverse Psychology:**  Suby promotes using techniques like subtly suggesting the prospect *doesn't* want to do things themselves, creating a desire for assistance.\n*   **“Permission” Principle:**  Always get the prospect’s explicit agreement before offering anything.\n\n**2. Bullet Points for Key Ideas & Steps**\n\n*   **Qualify ruthlessly:** Don't waste time on unqualified leads. Ask targeted questions to assess their needs and buying intent.\n*   **Tell a Story:**  People connect with stories. Frame your pitch as a narrative, not a dry sales presentation.\n*   **Mirroring:**  Suby advocates for mirroring the prospect's language and tone to build rapport.\n*   **Build a Deep Connection:** Spend significant time getting to know the prospect.\n*   **Offer Value First:**  Provide helpful information and advice *before* attempting a sale.\n*   **The \"Five-Minute Rule\":** Aim for a 5-minute conversation – that's the sweet spot for building trust.\n*   **Handle Objections Directly:**  Don't skirt around objections; address them head-on.\n*   **The “Fear of Missing Out” (FOMO):** Leverage the fear of losing an opportunity to drive urgency.\n\n\n\n**3. Q&A (Implied/Stated)**\n\n*   **Q:** “How do I find out what my prospect *really* wants?”\n    *   **A (Suby):** “Dig deep.  Ask open-ended questions, probe for emotions, and truly listen to the answers.”\n*   **Q:** “How do I overcome resistance?”\n    *   **A (Suby):** “Address their concerns directly, use reverse psychology, and build a strong connection.”\n*   **Q:** “What if the prospect doesn’t immediately see the value?”\n    *   **A (Suby):** “Keep offering value.  Build trust over time.  Be patient.”\n\n**4. Case Examples/Stories**\n\n*   **The “Luxury Car” Story:** Suby recounts a conversation with a prospect who explicitly stated he didn't want to spend a fortune on a car. Suby skillfully used reverse psychology, highlighting the value proposition of a high-end vehicle, ultimately leading to a sale.\n*   **The “Security” Story:**  Suby shares a scenario where a prospect's stated priority was security. He then positioned a product or service as a way to address that need, driving the sale.\n\n\n\n**5. Copywriting Formulas**\n\n*   **PAS (Problem – Agitation – Solution):** Suby heavily employs this framework to capture attention, heighten the prospect's pain, and then present his offering as the solution.\n*   **AIDA (Attention – Interest – Desire – Action):** He uses AIDA to guide his messaging, ensuring a logical flow from capturing attention to driving action.\n\n\n**6. Classification of Content**\n\n*   **Naming:** (Focus on understanding prospect motivations & needs)\n*   **Ads:** (Storytelling, PAS framework)\n*   **Psychology:** (Reverse psychology, mirroring, building rapport, understanding motivations)\n*   **Copywriting:** (AIDA, PAS)\n\n\n**7. Step-by-Step Guide (Based on Suby’s Framework)**\n\n1.  **Qualify:** Immediately ask 3-5 key questions to identify the prospect’s needs and priorities.\n2.  **Listen Deeply:** Truly understand *why* they are interested. Don't just listen to their words; read their body language.\n3.  **Tell a Story:** Frame your pitch to resonate with their values and aspirations.\n4.  **Mirror & Build Rapport:** Use mirroring techniques to establish a connection.\n5.  **Offer Value:** Provide helpful information and advice—establish yourself as a trusted advisor.\n6.  **Address Objections:** Anticipate and address potential concerns proactively.\n7.  **Close with Confidence:**  When the time is right, confidently propose the solution.\n\n**8.

Bullet Points for Key Ideas/Steps:**\n\n*   **Understand Audience Temperature:** Identify the level of interest/readiness your audience has.\n*   **Cold Traffic (Tinder Profile):** Use lower-commitment CTAs (quizzes, guides, competitions).\n*   **Warm Traffic (Second Date):**  Test the waters, present value, and build rapport.\n*   **Hot Traffic (Netflix & Chill):**  Directly offer the sale – they're already engaged and ready.\n*   **Match Message to Temperature:** Crucially, align your offer and communication style with the audience’s current level of interest.\n\n**3. Q&A (Implied/Stated):**\n\n*   **Question:** What’s the biggest mistake marketers make?\n    *   **Answer:** Failing to align messaging with audience temperature.\n*   **Question:** What should I do with cold traffic?\n    *   **Answer:** Offer low-commitment CTAs.\n*   **Question:** How do I handle warm traffic?\n    *   **Answer:** Test the waters, offer value and build relationships.\n\n\n\n**4.

When was the last\ntime you saw a Google ad and picked up and bought something without\neven clicking on the ad and checking out that website?\nSo if you can’ t possibly sell somebody directly from the ad, why try doing\nit in the first place? It’ s just sett ing you up for a fail.

They are the biggest ma rket, and marketing to them can give you a\nhuge advantage over your competitor s. Y ou just need to know how to treat\nthem. They might be right on the edge of buying but just need a little\nsomething more. So, you engage The Magic Lantern T echnique and send\nthese fence-sitters a video sequence that teaches them something that\nultimately moves them closer to their desired outcome.\nThis is a series of two or three  videos that give them pure value. They’re\nnot selling anything, just givin g them some value in advance  and taking\nthem closer to their desired outcome.
