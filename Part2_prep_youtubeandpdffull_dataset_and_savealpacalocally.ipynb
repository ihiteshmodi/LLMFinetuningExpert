       "[Document(page_content=\"productivity is how much money you get out for the time you put in I know this because I went from $0 at age 23 to $100 million plus net worth at age 31 simply by better investing my time and I'm going to teach you how I do it so that hopefully you can do it and I'm even going to show you my calendar at the end of the video and walk you through step by step how I get good Returns on my time have you ever had someone reach out to you and say hey God minute hey got 10 hey let me introduce you to so and so they're going to be in town how does 10 a.m. work a normal exchange like that you might say yeah I've Got 5 minutes or sure I can meet so and so for coffee the problem is that for one specific type of worker that five-minute meeting blows their entire morning because they can't do the development work they need they can't edit the video they can't write the book chapter because it disrupts their workflow on the other hand there's another type of worker where for them it's actually very optimal for them to take that meeting the question is which one are you and at what times also special shout out to Paul Graham who wrote a tiny blog this 14 years ago so if time is what we invest and money is what we make from that investment then the people who are the best investors of time were the ones who make the most money and so it turns out there are two specific types of entrepreneurs and you'll switch hats throughout your day or throughout your week the first and most common investor of time that people are familiar with is the manager schedule and these people have a very specific way of investing time and getting Returns on it so they can make the most money so let's talk about that managers divide their time into the smallest chunk possible they often have 20 plus chunks per day from 15 minutes sometimes 5 minutes all the way to an hour or 90 minutes and for managers an empty time slot is a lost opportunity that's time that did not get a return on investment for them and for that reason they treat time like currency and the only real cost for them to fill is just the cost of coordinating with somebody else's calendar to find a mutually empty slot so that they can work together now on paper since work on meetings is a mutually filled slot it makes both people more productive and so when a manager interacts with another manager and they mutually fill a slot both of them make more money now they talk to lots of different people and do many different kinds of tasks all day long this is the nature of the manager they collect data they report data to persuade to lead to train and encourage and make other decisions one-on one and sometimes in groups of people for them they have a pretty clear beginning of the day and a pretty clear end of the day the day begins when they start preparing for their meetings maybe 30 minutes or an hour beforehand and it ends at the end of their last meeting now if they prep for the next day then they could add that on top but more or less the duration of their day is directly proportional to the duration of the meetings they have they basically work until their last calendar slot and that's how their day works and this is the key Point here the main objective of the manager is to use up all their chunks in the day day so that they maximize their time a fully booked day is a maximally invested manager they've used up all of their time slots and so they are productive now the second type of time schedule management is something called the maker and this is one that the vast majority of people do not know this is where the creators this is where the entrepreneurs this is where people who have to make big things who build stuff get the highest returns on their time the vast majority of entrepreneurs at some point have some or all of their time that's dedicated to making stuff this is the Deep work this is the stuff that moves the big ball forward there are often tasks that are not urgent but incredibly important and when you look back on your month or your quarter or your year the few things that you remember that actually move the ball forward that actually move your business forward in the long term were these chunks of work now the problem is most entrepreneurs do not have the time and do not have the system for maximizing that time of important work because fundamentally if those are the footholds that allow you to push yourself forward towards your goal then you want as many of those as possible the difficulty is that it's never urgent this is like if you're a coder and you need to develop software obviously if that software is developed that's the most valuable thing you can do if you're an editor and you make videos then actually editing the video so that it can get out in media is the most important thing that you can do if you write copy for emails or you're an author and you write books you actually writing the book and actually doing the work of the book is the most important thing that you can do all of those things are maker work you create something that before this did not exist although this work is important it's incredibly expensive in terms of time and the problem is the vast majority of the world works on manager time not on maker time so let me explain the difference so for the maker when you get into maker mode instead of many small slivers like the manager has you have only a few large chunks and the reason for that is because if you put a meeting or you interrupt a 4-Hour long block then you often can't get back to the work that you were doing before also if you know that you have a block that's coming you can't get into the flow because you know that you're going to have to get out of the flow and so this is like the end of day meeting that kills you this is called the zernick effect it's that we tend to remember open loops and meetings are open Loops because you have to set timers so you don't forget it you have to start setting a timer before the timer to start wrapping up even if you're using right now then you start thinking about the meeting and what you have to prepare for that meeting and now you're not thinking about your own work and this eats up your brain power and saps your ability to make unlike the manager where the decisions the direction and the coordination is the output of their work for the maker the stuff the things they build the things they make is the output of their time and so instead of working on meetings they work off meetings they work on projects that can't get done in 30es minutes sometimes those projects last weeks months quarters until they're done and so the way that that work actually looks is that most makers have a set start time but variable end times so unlike the manager where they they know when they start and they know when they finish most makers work open to goal if you've ever lost yourself in your work and you're like man I just want to keep riding this this High I want to keep riding this flow that's what it feels like to make you want to stay in there as long as you possibly can and that's why having no cap on the allows you to get lost in the work and produce more than you ever could so if you have only large time chunks that means that you only have one or two per day sometimes three if you're working 18 hours and so that means you usually have a morning block and a post lunch block now if you're somebody who likes to also work after dinner then you have a post dinner block so you basically have three four to six hour chunks per day that's it and on a sustainable basis most people just have two per day and so if someone takes one meeting in the morning they blew one of your 10 work blocks per week if you only work 5 days a week and so someone's taking 10% of your total output by having one meeting the issue is that that manager who's working on manager time puts that thing in and for them they're becoming more productive but they're destroying your productivity when this happens is when you finish your day feel like you look back and know that all your time was spent but you got no return on it you have nothing to show for it and if you feel like you have that happen again and again and again this is how businesses stay small this is how entrepreneurs fail to grow This Is How They relive the same 6 months same 12 months same two years over and over and over again because they do not know how to invest their time for the maker an empty time slot is not a lost opportunity the empty time block is the opportunity to get the return if you're a maker you understand what I'm about to share with you if you look at your calendar and see that you have literally nothing on there you have no meetings you have no nothing it's just empty until the end of the day how much energy are you filled with you're like oh my God I'm going to crush this day there's all this this big project I want to sink my teeth into it I'm going to be able to take a huge chunk out of it that energy that you get is because that is a maximally productive day is an empty calendar rather than a filled calendar and so for context when I was writing my book my days every day were just writing the book and I told my team that that's all I was going to be doing you're like but don't you run this portfolio of all these companies and there's all this money and these deals and decisions that have to happen and the answer is yes and when I show you my calendar it'll all Mak sense so literally diametrically opposed calendars are both maximally allocated to invest time to get the highest Returns on it in terms of money the big problem is when the two need to interact because if you just had makers making and you just had managers managing everyone would be happy the problem is when managers manage makers and they have to meet so when a manager doesn't know how makers work they kill the productivity of their team managers often assume that makers can work like they do on demand they think it's hey it's just 30 minutes and you've got free time what's the big deal I looked at your calendar you have nothing all day you're barely even working because they're using their measuring stick of work their way a calendar looks when they're maximally effective and then transposing that on top of the Maker's calendar and thinking these two are the same when they couldn't be more different for a manager a short meeting costs one work unit which is maybe 15 minutes and for them they've got 20 plus per day so they can easily spare one whereas if they take one from a maker they take one of the two time slots you have per day and sometimes you take both based on what the topic of the meeting is if you say hey we're going to do your quarterly performance as an employee at 2:00 in the afternoon the likelihood that the employee leading up to that is going to be able to think about the work that they're going to do when they're worried about their job or they're worried about their performance all day long and then afterwards they thinking about what they said and they could have said differently that day shot to make matters worse if a maker is falling behind the manager's solution is to interrupt them more which creates a vicious cycle this means managers prevent the work that they check in on so by checking in on them they disrupt the Maker's work so that they can't actually make during the time slot to check in if they're actually working because the manager Works while on meetings where the Maker Works when they're off meetings and when this happens and it happens often both parties lose and this is the main point the manager loses because the maker is not making what they need to be making and the manager is responsible for some level of output so both people aren't making the best Returns on their time this is why this is important for managers and important for makers so if you are on a team share this with your boss share this with your teammates so that this become like this can become more common in the Lexicon all my companies understand and use this language if you ask as a manager for a maker to make time for you they either one offend the manager by saying no I can't do that because I'm working and the M manager's like well I see that you have an empty time block and I outrank you or even if your peers it's like what do you mean you're not going to give me that time I see that it's empty by refusing them they offend and they can incur other risks by making that you know offense and declining the invitation this often time damages the relationship and decreases the likelihood of collaboration in the future which they might need you as a maker might need the buying of that manager and so you risk losing that Goodwill by declining the invitation but by doing so if you accept the invitation you destroy the morning right and so option one piss someone off option two destroy half your day a very terrible proposition and the crazy part is that even if you accept that meeting often times the yield from that meeting is nothing because the person who had the do you have five minutes didn't really have an agenda didn't really have a plan and just basically said I'm just going to steal your morning from you and give you nothing back by the way this totally applies to networking stuff too if you're like hey let me ince you to John he's in the area you guys should meet for coffee does 10:00 a.m. work I'm like yeah let's just destroy everything right let's just light my whole day on fire so that I can meet John who you think I have synergies with maybe there's potential for collaboration let's explore opportunities together you know what's crazy I know what I need to do to make more money and I just need to do that I get asked all the time about what's the one habit that you have that has been the highest you know predictor of your success and I really genuinely believe that it has been this is that I have been ruthless with my time everyone who knows me knows that I am a dick with my time and the thing is is that I've been able to maintain relationships because during that maker time where I say no to everyone else I keep moving forward because I have a fundamental belief that as long as I continue to achieve and I continue to make things that are valuable for the World those meetings those connections those synergies that friend dinner will always be there and that has proven right in my life and in the beginning it was the hardest because I didn't have the accomplishments to show for it but I truly believed I was like I know that if I can get this stuff done and I do it every single day for a year two years three years five years if every day I move the ball forward that's the thing at the end of the month when I look back on what I actually accomplished 100% of it is stuff I accomplished during maker time not manager time and so once I realized that the maker time was where everything all the speed of me moving towards my goal was getting accomplished then I spent the rest of my time trying to optimize my life and create a system around this that allowed me to do as much of that as I possibly could and to be clear there are roles in the business like if you're CEO or coo from an operator perspective you're going to have more one-on ones you're going to have more team trainings you're going to have more coordination and decision-making that's required but you just have to be clear that you're not not doing your job by not having maker time it's just that your job is the manager stuff and then the maker time you have is to get more leverage on the remainder of your manager time and so ilila has a different schedule than I do she still has maker time but it's probably inverted in terms of her schedule for her she has probably one maker day per week and four manager days where I have four maker days per week and one manager day and so you can have an inverted schedule but the important thing is is that she has to have that makeer day because it's what gets her leverage gets her higher Returns on the other four days of the week and then for me I have to still do that manager day because it gives me leverage on all the organizational decisions that have to happen throughout the whole portfolio you have to get out of the either or thinking and think which of these Styles is best for me in this particular moment but I can promise you that you do have elements of both when most people have elements of neither which is why they never move forward so I think I've accurately described the problem here makers and managers work differently these guys want empty calendars these guys want filled calendars when they interact one person destroys the other person time and it's a disproportionate trade and when things get bad they get even worse because the managers interrupt the makers even more and the makers trying to be polite because they don't want to turn down invitations just make their lives worse and worse and they have to work longer and longer hours lose sleep lose family time lose their weekend so that they can just keep up with their work without pissing anyone off and so let's talk about a different way way to do this so I use something called a three-pronged approach for the solutions and that's because you have to address it from all angles it's not just saying hey makers deal with it hey managers do something different hey organizations you have to attack it from all three directions you've got the managers you've got what the makers should do differently and then you've got the organization overall so you've got all three of these parties that you have to accommodate to the managers step one under understand both the costs that you put on the maker the first cost is the cost of coordinating times while they work so they're trying to work right now before you coordinate the time that you're also going to disrupt them so you disrupt them while they're working and then you disrupt them at the meeting that you're trying to plan so you disrupt them twice secondly and once you have that time set aside understand that the time itself eats an entire work block itself and you have to know the difference between your work and the Maker's work and when you ask for a meeting it costs them 10 times more you use up one of their 10 time slots per week whereas you use up only one of your hundred or more time slots so when you choose to make an appointment or choose to make a meeting be sure that it's worth it especially if it's an ad hoc or impromptu if you have a set Cadence of communication if it can wait until that time and you got to be really real with yourself can it wait is this just a convenience thing for me or a preference if it is then don't destroy the poor man or poor woman's time step two understand the value of the makers no and this is something that I hopefully becomes incorporate in your Lexicon at your business is that this is a maker's no not a not a real world no it's a maker's no is that if a maker declines a meeting don't take offense see it as them actually trying to keep their larger commitment to you the company and other people to get the meaningful work they need to get done done and so this means you don't get offended this means you don't you know hold back the the promotion or say that they're not being productive because they keep turning down meetings if someone turns down the meeting it's because they're doing something that they can accurately say this is more important than that now if you as a manager say I know that you have this is going to destroy the morning in terms of your productivity but I think it is worth your time to be on this because we need your Insight then you can frame it that way and then you can give the maker the time to prep for that meeting if it is literally of that importance step three for managers is actually ask your team what an ideal day would look like for them like what's a maximum productive day look like like and allow them the time to give you the response and I suggest following that to the greatest degree possible so that you can actually help them be the most productive and so for example for us uh our media team leaders asked the editing team underneath of them hey what's the perfect day for you guys what's a perfect weekly calendar look like and as a team they were like well if we could just Bunch all the meetings here and we could have all the rest of the days free that would be awesome and then if we had it was like okay well how do what about when we coordinate it's okay well we'll have specific coordination times that we keep four brainstorming sessions and things like that but beyond that we keep everyone's calendars empty and so that way as a team you as a as a manager also can have fewer meetings so that you can fill out with other meetings that aren't makers right so you can do more leading more directing more encouraging more persuading more training and then let the makers make and we've also realized and I think you will break your own belief around this as soon as you start doing this that a lot of work doesn't have to be done at the same time everyone doesn't need to work on the same thing at the same moment to get the most done as long as everything gets done by this period of time now this video isn't the protect the makers video this is for all businesses and all business owners so let's talk to the makers now step one good managers want to help you so let them tell them how you work this is you communicating to them send this piece of content to them to help them help you and yes you will have to take meetings that eat your entire day sometimes it's part of the job you have have to work with other people because your project would never see the light of day without marketing marketing it sales selling it product delivering it and everything else that happens in between it's a team and so if your manager is going to choose to put a Time Block in the middle of your morning or the middle of your afternoon then switch that whole block into a manager schedule Fight Fire with Fire and try to knock out as many meetings as you can in that formally free time so that means that okay if I know that I'm going to have this one time slot that's killed my big chunk well then let's slice that baby into as many chunks as I can and get all the other ad hoc impromptu meetings done that morning so that I now switch to a maximally productive manager and so the thing is is that you don't want to identify as one or the other you just want your calendar to reflect the nature of the work and so the point here isn't to have two camps of makers and managers is to understand what type of productivity system you're installing for that period of time on your calendar because especially if you're an entrepreneur you've got to wear both step two for makers have standard meeting times where you accept meetings so you say Hey you know Monday and uh Thursday afternoons is when I have all of my meeting times open so whenever someone requests a meeting ask them if they can make it in those times and this is where when you get into the organization if everyone has those times then everyone's on maker schedules for those time blocks and then it becomes more efficient at an organizational level which I'll get to in a second it's rare that a meeting is truly urgent so if you can push them off to those designated blocks that you said ahead of time you will make a lot more money with the time that you have remaining and you want to make this time available to anyone who meets with you on a regular basis and add some empty time slots or leave some empty time slots in that maker meetings for the ad hoc meetings that inevitably come up I would say I've gone through three distinct periods of understanding this maker manager concept and using it to great success the first one is you basically have to do nights and weekends uh in Early Mornings in order to get your maker time in but you have to do it and so when I was doing this as a gym owner so a small business owner I would wake up and I would like work on ad copy and work on ads which was like deep work that I'd have to do and then I'd step into the gym at 9:00 a.m. and start taking sales calls or uh take training sessions or have to have one on- ones with my trainers like I worked like a regular person with fires and people interrupting me all day because I was running a small business and so if you need to make sure that that maker work gets done then you need to find one block that's usually at the very beginning of the day or the very end of the day if you're the entrepreneur and no one cares about your time in the beginning if I had not done that I don't think I ever would have gotten out of one location I would never have been able to build the systems that it takes like how do you build the training system to get trainers on you do it in maker time how do you build the nutrition system that you're going to use for your whole location you do it during maker time how you going to run an advertising system for creating ads and writing copy on a regular basis you do that during maker time not during manager time and so to build the assets that I could build the business on top of to build the Enterprise I had to do that in uninterrupted time chunks and the problem was everybody want to interrupt my time and to be fair they could because I didn't have my my time wasn't super valuable in the beginning over time you'll begin to have people who can start protecting your time for you so for a big chunk of my career as I started to make more and more money the first half of every day until noon or 1 p.m. was always wide open because I do my best work in the morning and then once I've kind of used up my Creative Juice I can do the coordination and meetings and things like that now I'll give you a second Pro tip on this which is if that is the way that you want to plan your calendar let's call yourself an intermediate entrepreneur start planning your day back to front so what I mean by that is someone wants a meeting you start at it ends at 5: and starts at 4: if someone else wants a meeting then you say it ends at it ends at 4 and starts at 3:30 and you work your calendar from Back to Front that way your front of the day is still the most open you possibly can have it now you still suffer from the quote zernick effect but you still have a very large chunk of uninterrupted time and by doing it this way you avoid those empty dead times where you're like great I have 45 minutes between two meetings like what am I going to do now and you're like I guess I'll just have a snack so if you have less means then you work double time you work on your client's time and then you do your work in off hours so like I was saying in my early days by doing that morning five days a week and then I would work both shifts on the weekends I would get four on the weekends I get a morning and an afternoon on Saturday and Sunday that I can put maker time in and then I get five blocks during the week and so this still gave me nine makers blocks per week to move Big Stuff forward that's a full-time job but the key here if you're noticing is that yes you work double because you have to work the job that you're currently doing to make money and then you work the next job to get out of the job you're in so the V1 of this is you have to make maker time the V2 of this is I I think is the 50/50 split the first half of your day is maker the second half of your day is manager and you work from Back to Front that's the V2 version the V3 version which is what I do currently right now is that I have entire maker days so I have two three four days per week that are just maker days and then I have a manager day where I stack the hell out of my meetings introductions you know coordinations decisions quarterly meetings with portfolio companies all of that type of stuff happens on those days back toback so I don't feel unproductive at the end of the day because I know going into it I'm not going to do any maker work I'm just going to crush as many meetings as I can step three communicate about how you're going to communicate tell people when you're going to be slow to respond specifically during your maker box so people have an amazing ability to adapt if you tell them ahead of time people really only get upset when you have unmet expectations they expect you to respond immediately and then you don't and then they question if you're working when the reality is that's why you're working is the fact that you're not responding so change them so let everyone know that this is how you work and this is when you're going to be responsive and if you do have that time period where you say you're going to be responsive then be responsive which leads to step four actually work when you say you will if you if you have the luxury of having people who respect your time and respect your schedule and understand this maker manager Dynamic then you owe it to them as a maker to not waste your time because if you don't you will confirm their suspicions this whole time that you've been goofing off all day because you're not actually working and that's what the vast majority of managers think when they look at your calendar and see that it's empty is that you're not actually doing anything and what you don't want to do is prove them right so I covered what you have to think about as a manager right you want to understand this lingo you want understand how makers work and you want to tryy and respect that and Empower them to the greatest degree possible as a maker you also want to understand that you work within an organization there are times that you're going to have to take meetings if you do take meetings you want to block that time and then Crush as many meetings as you possibly can be responsive when you say you're going to be responsive and then work like a madman during the times that you actually have empty time slots on your calendar great so we have both of those covered but how do we install this into an organization so that we can make this Canon so that we can make this standard and this is what I'm hoping across many organizations so if I can use my platform to like help businesses make more money and help people actually enjoy their work more than like can't think of a higher return on my time than doing that across thousands and thousands of businesses so as an organization and this is if you're the entrepreneur who can make those decisions step one consider mandated quiet time on the calendar so during these times entire teams can't message one another or meet and so either make this a a a time of day every day or make this entire days of the week so for example for us Wednesdays are quiet days for the editing team like no one talks there are no meetings they can just crank on one or two big projects they want to work on throughout that day and I want to be very clear on this caveat it doesn't need to apply to the entire organization only the ones where you have makers so think Engineers developers copywriters editors Builders writers presenters media whatever the people who have to work on projects that require intense periods of time without interruption the reason I I think this is more important now than ever is because of remote work remote work has removed the transparency between someone working and so I could walk I can walk around my office now and walk past the editing Bas and see people plugged in working on their computers editing so I know they're editing even though their time block is empty if I just check their calendar but in a remote setting if I look at someone's calendar and see it's empty but I have no way to check in on them or see them then I don't know if they're actually working or if they're just like rock climbing and so I have no way to know that then you think okay well I'll just slack them but by doing the slack message you then disrupt them anyways and if they're super responsive on slack you feel like they're working when the likelihood is that if they're really responsive on slack they're not working cuz they're on slack and so the real real is that if you're remote or the teams that you have that are doing making a remote you have to have an element of trust and you still need to measure on output so you can give I would say basically extend longer periods of trust where you say hey we have this big project this is the deadline for that project and then you want to remove as many obstacles as you possibly can to allow that person to work and let's also be real there have been days where I wake up and I'm like I don't have it in me like wherever the magic is or the Muse didn't show up to work today sometimes if you're a if you're a maker then maybe see if you can get meetings on that day because you're like dude my brain's dead like I don't think I'm going to I'm going to create anything today but there are some days where I wake up and I feel like the the touch of God is upon me and I'm like oh my God I think I actually can cure cancer today and when that happens then sometimes it's worth changing the meetings and saying hey man I'm in the middle of something right now and I'm crushing it is there any way we can just meet later you know what's crazy most people when they get that message are like sure no problem it wasn't urgent anyways and sometimes they're like you know what we don't even need to reschedule the meeting I actually handled it already and so I would strongly encourage you as a maker to kind of keep a pulse on yourself and also managers to extend the time trust where you allow makers to make now if they do not meet the deadlines and they are not meeting the output then you need to be very clear about this is the trust that extending to you so what is the reason that you have for not getting this done and real real a lot of times you actually have to dig into their personal lives cuz that's usually the mess anyways as an entrepreneur you're often going to have times where you're a maker and a times where you're a manager and being clear to your team about Which hat you're wearing so I literally say hey I'm putting my maker hat on today hey manager hat before I step into something and that gives me and them a mental cue to know how I'm operating for that day and kind of the Rules of Engagement and by doing it that way it sets it's it sets all the expectations with one thing one change of hat rather than me have to re-explain the rules every time all right before the last and most important point for organizations let me show you my calendar and walk you through it so this is an actual time uh block I think today is the 31st of May um as we're actually recording this and so this is my this is my actual calendar and so you'll notice that we had uh we had Labor Day weekend right so Monday um I actually took off on Monday um so this was a short week but Wednesday Thursday Friday I have nothing on here except for maker time so you recording for me is maker time like I'm making these videos I can't do this and then take a meeting and then come back and make this video right like I have to stay in it until it's done and so this whole day all three of these days are just straight up empty and you can see I have a gym meeting with myself uh in the afternoon so I can get swole so I was telling you that on Wednesdays we have our quiet day for editors but it's actually organization wide and we just separated people into are you a maker are you a manager and so if you're a manager you deal with lots of time slots and this just doesn't apply to you but for everyone else in the organization which everyone else has transparency into all of Wednesday is an acquisition. comom quiet day and the reason that we put it on Wednesday was that way if you think about how the week works out it's like you have two quiet days on the weekend no matter what and then you have two days that could potentially get interrupted with another day in between so basically the longest amount of time that you have to wait is two days before you can have a guaranteed quiet day now you'll notice that Tuesday basically functioned as my Monday for this week I had a team meeting with my whole company I had a one1 with my head of investment he's the one who runs our deals I had my executive meeting uh which is just uh all the leaders in my company at acquisition. comom I had a oneon-one with my book manager I had um meeting with our Workshop manager because uh we wanted to touch base and after that meeting I said let's not have this meeting anymore immediately after the meeting so to be clear like I try to always audit like do I need to do this again or is there a processor a person who can do this instead of me and most times there is a processor person after after that I had my school games Q&A so I had once a week I take a call with the school games and notice I do these calls that I have with customers on my meeting day because it's still an interruption and it to me it feels the same it's like I hop on I'm asking questions I'm answering questions I'm directing I'm doing whatever then I had my marketing meeting for our internal marketing stuff and that was it I had a hair trim and then I had my gym all right and so you'll be like wait that's it I just saw Alex's whole week that's all the meetings he takes and the answer is yes now I think what might be more important than the things that you saw or the things that you didn't see and so there's meetings that happen all the time with the leadership with my team and portfolio companies with you know my media buyer and their media buyer my you know uh portfolio operating partner and the CEOs of the companies that we own right all of those meetings you'll note none of them were on my calendar at some point I see the entrepreneurial Journey as a relinquishing of control and at every level of Entrepreneurship you need to learn a new level of giving up control and so it's interesting is that when we get into entrepreneurship we do it because we want freedom but as soon as we do it to get Freedom we actually have absolute control over everything because you have control of you're a solo preneur now like you have no team it's just you but when you have control over everything you actually don't have freedom so you cannot have both absolute control and absolute freedom at the same time and so if you want freedom you have to relinquish control you have to extend trust to people now those trusts can have guard rails and you can still have outputs that you measure people on and then you basically tighten up the Reigns if things don't go to plan but as as long as people are doing their job and meeting the outputs then you can continue to kind of extend the leash I don't really like the terminology but you get the idea and so at the end of every one of these meetings I'm telling you like if you could just put a little reminder to yourself those do I need to do this again a like does this meeting even need to occur again and secondarily is there somebody else or a system we can put in place to eliminate this all together Lila and I she's even better about this because she has more meetings as an operator than I do um every single week she starts her week by looking at all of her meetings and deletes she deletes first and then on a quarterly basis she looks at all recurring meetings and says how do I how can I change the time that's being allocated across the whole company so she sees everyone's calendars and everyone's meetings she does some Rainman stuff where she says I don't think we need to do this anymore I think we can combine these two I think you don't need to attend the and she tells people I don't think you need to attend this anymore I don't think you need to attend this and I think that's where a culture of meetings don't make you productive is a very important subline here for organizations in general and you'll notice this with Elon Musk and basos and some of these these great entrepreneurs they talk about this where they want to standardize like hey you can get up in the middle of meeting and say hey I've just got stuff I need to do and I don't think I'm relevant here or I don't think I'm adding value that's you returning time to the company because this is the thing that everyone forgets is that let's say let's say uh you make $50,000 a year that means that you make around $25 per hour in general and so if you have and let's say you've got some people are making $100,000 a year on the meeting so that's $50 per hour that means that if you have 10 people on that on a on a on a one-h hour call it's like that was a $500 call or a $400 call now if we took the whole team out to Chili's and we spent $400 on drinks and chips and whatever it'd be considered a major expense right but every day all the time you're taking the whole team out to chilies 10 times a day this is why people stay poor because they don't know how to allocate time to get the highest return so let's walk through the last step for organizations to make this real to get the most out of everyone spread this content to Makers and managers alike so that everyone can use the same language to describe this larger source of waste and prevent it because if you are working with a maker manager schedule where everyone understands where people can get the highest returns in their time and your comp competition is not working this way you will get higher returns Returns on human capital on the time you invest in people because they will be happier they will stay longer they will have higher output and the quality of their work will go up so you'll both get higher quantity of work and higher quality of work both by changing how you allocate time and try and actively remove as many makers as possible from meetings and also managers don't need to be there and my goal with this video is to increase the awareness of these two types of working Styles and put words to something that plagued me for a very long time and so if you're listening to this and you're like this is music to my ears this is what I've been trying to describe for such a long time and I have been able to put words to it I made this for you so that I could put words to something that hopefully everyone else can use and distribute at a bargain on time is that you don't have to worry about making this thing you can just send it so that people can understand it for you and hopefully this gives words to the makers whose work moves the world and helps managers understand how expensive got a minute really is\",

       " Document(page_content=\"in this video i'm going to tell you a story about how i solved to churn for the entire gym industry and i think there are a lot of things you can take from this both in the actual outcome itself but also the process that was used to achieve it one of the things i'm going to i'm going to rewind the time clock here so for those who don't know me i had a chain of gyms in california um i was founded in 2013 i had six gyms by by 2016 that i grew uh just using cash flow from the the growth of the facilities and so i was very good at the marketing and selling process of getting people in the gyms and opening them at full capacity which was kind of my claim to fame over time i then uh pivoted to licensing uh that acquisition system to other gym owners across the u.s right so that was kind of the the path and then jim mulch kind of took off from there there was a two-year stint in between there where i did turnarounds and i'd fill other people's gyms up uh for a percentage of the revenue that i was bringing in right so that was kind of that's the the long story short now fast forward and uh now we've got thousands of gyms right uh this is still a few years ago but fast forward in the story it's got a few thousand gyms at this time one of the issues is that all these guys are bringing people in the door but they can't retain them for a long time so they can convert them into members because we had a process around that which again was sales but uh they couldn't keep them for a long time right and this was and this wasn't because of the acquisition system they just couldn't keep any of their customers for a long time and so what's interesting about this is that this is for any type of service based business that has any kind of recurring you know uh revenue model whatsoever and so here's what i did to solve a problem that i did not know the answer to all right so this is the this is the takeaway that you can you can take from this so what i did was i said hey guys has anyone in this huge community uh achieved three percent monthly churn or less for six straight months all right so three percent monthly turn if you do the math on it let's actually look together shall we so if we want to see how much what percentage of your customers are staying and if you have let's say three percent monthly churns that's 0.97 right and let's say that this is for 12 months all right so we're going to go x to the y for 12 months that means that i'm going to keep 69 of my customers i'm going to lose 31 of my customers year over year if i have 3 monthly churn that's still a decent amount of customers that we're losing right just being real with you now 3 is like the top 1 percent of gyms i'll be real with you like most gyms do not do that the industry average is about nine percent now if you want us to have something that freaks you out let's just do this one together so nine percent means we're retaining 91 per month now we're going to do our little twisty twistiness so that we can do our fancy math we go x to the y and we'll do 12 months again right right look at the difference there 32 of your clients are still there meaning you lose 68 of your of your recurring clients if your monthly churn is nine percent this is why people don't want to buy these types of businesses this is what makes your business unsellable and so i had this problem right i was like all these gyms are acquiring customers and their industry average is that they're going to lose uh three quarters you know of their customers by the end of the year right right this is a problem because i'm going to have to keep showing them all these new tips and tricks to get new people in because literally by the end of the year they're going to have already turned over three-quarters of the customers right this is a problem so this is what i did i put a poll in the group and i said hey if you've had less than three percent monthly churn for six straight months i'd like to invite you to a round table so 20 people out of the you know thousands or so they were in the community at the time 20 all right it's a very small percentage said hey i i meet this qualification so i said okay so if you think about this math wise right i've already got the top one percent um i guess this is the top two percent but top two percent of the entire entire gym world and so i had them all together on a call and i said i need you to tell me every single thing that you do to provide uh excellent value or a customer surplus uh to your members right and so i went person by person by person and i would sit there and i was like and then what do you do and then how does that work and then why do you do that and xyz right and i wrote down every single thing that every one of them had and so by the end of this i had like four pages of notes right so this is what i did next so that you know we ended the call and so i looked through all the notes and then i re-categorized them because a lot of them were repetitive some of them were you know different you know one-off weird things and so i said okay it's clear that all of them do lots of things and the first one being they actually track it and focus on the metric which 95 of people don't even do which is why most people are poor number one second thing that all of them did is that they had lots of different strategies to to combat churn because they know uh that and you guys want to know something crazy of course you do we're watching the the world's coolest youtuber all right so uh if you let's say let's say you have a service that's 100 a month okay 100 bucks a month and let's say that your churn is three percent right because that was the that was the goal of these people right so three percent churn all right and so what i did was i did a hundred divided by three percent that's thirty three hundred dollars of ltv right lifetime value right lifetime amount of revenue they're gonna be able to collect over this customer if they pay a hundred dollars a month you're gonna get 33 months out of this person because it's 100 divided by 0.03 watch this same 100 price point remember i said the industry average was nine divided by point zero nine eleven eleven all right eleven hundred bucks is what the ltv of those gyms are so the people who had conquered their churn made three times more revenue per customer than everyone else but here's what's even crazier about that if you make three times more revenue per customer think about how much more profit you're making a lot more all right and this is why this is such an important thing so a lot of them were doing lots of things i consolidated all of the things into buckets and then i said what are the things that every single one of them is doing and you can think about this like a voting system if if if all of them are doing one thing then that's probably an important thing if i've got 20 guys and there's something that only one of them is doing it's probably not important because the other 19 are accomplishing the objective without doing it and so the goal is how little how few of these things are the things that are actually driving the outcome okay and so what i ended up figuring out uh after doing this entire process is that there were five things that they were all doing to maintaining their members now you can either say oh okay alex well the next five things that he's going to share are probably only for gyms yeah because humans are totally different in your business but anyways so let's rock and roll first thing that they were all doing all of them is that if someone missed uh and uh they're they're not showing up at the gym by wednesday of that week so they missed monday miss tuesday they escalated them and they had all of them had different processes around this some of them did it by friday some of them did it by tuesday but the end point was if someone was not consuming the service they immediately escalated it and would repeatedly try and contact them to get them scheduled for time to come in which means they had accountability around consumption number one number two the vast majority of them had exit interviews meaning if someone wanted to leave they would have to come in and talk to somebody and there's two benefits to this one is you get to identify the things that are wrong with your business because these people will tell you why they are leaving this gives you the opportunity to fix things that are not good which is great which is incredibly valuable data right number one number two is a lot of times people just need to vent and the things that they're venting about it sounds like pain means it can be solved which means a lot of times over half those people get resold into a higher level package it's like no one ever contact me is like well you're not in the contact me plan you're in the you know do-it-yourself plan you should get into the into the coaching level where we actually hold you accountable oh i didn't know you guys had that yeah we just didn't know that you needed that ah that's our fault we should have asked you better questions on the front end right right cool and then all of a sudden this person goes from being a loss and a cancel to being an ascension so number one they make sure people are consuming number two they save exit interviews so they can collect data and to send existing customers number three they all did member events all right so they had some sort of community component that happened on a regular basis the the extent to which they had it uh was different the cadence was different but i'll tell you right now that if you do it on a quarterly basis uh that usually works you know for in terms of bringing the community together you're usually in good hands number four is that they had handwritten cards that they would send out on a regular basis to each of the people in their community and some of them would send it out with gift cards to bring friends which is a great way to generate referrals as well some of them would just have it as appreciation some of them would give them some sort of kudos or or whatever and here's the key point about how these cards had to be written they had to be personalized all right so it can't just be hey thanks for being a member love you lots send er doesn't work it has to be hey charlotte you've really been advancing on your pull-ups and if you're like well this only works for gyms i'm not even going to comment on that use your brain can you personalize something to any kind of improvement that someone has had in your business probably hopefully but it's like hey charlotte you've made a lot of progress in your pull-ups when you got here you had to use the big thick black band and now you're using the yellow band which is you know twice is twice as uh hard in terms of the resistance level for you keep you know keep it up you're doing a great job and you're already down 10 pounds so they're also reminding them of the victories that are happening right on a recurring basis and the fifth one i honestly cannot remember what the fifth one was but the point of this story is the process of solving the problem right that was the point all right the process of solving the problem and that you can use this for any type of complex problem that you have and so the way that this is done this is called a consultative method but you go and you talk to experts in the space so if you sit on top of a community all of the solutions to all of the problems that you have already exist in that community someone has solved it and so all you have to do is get all the smartest people in one room and then interview them tabulate the answers use a weighing system of which of these answers comes up most frequently and then consolidate to what are the fewest number of these things that everyone is doing to solve this complex problem and a lot of times when you use that type of process and that type of thinking you will be able to solve the more complicated issues that come up in business and a lot of times the payouts can be rich and very rewarding all right oh remember the fifth thing every two weeks they were able to contact them on a personal basis independent of uh the service based stuff so it's just checking in on them as humans every other week or so so it's like hey you know imagine your phone buzzes with a text every 14 days every 21 days or so and it says hey uh just checking in how's life how's you know how's things how you doing um just just making sure everything's great and uh you know just want to help you you know accomplish your goals whatever right and so uh you get that text from your service provider you're like wow it almost appears as though they care isn't that wild of course it is and that is why people pay you to pay attention that is what they are literally paying for all right people want your attention and so do not automate what you should systematize it's one of the things i have when it comes to service as soon as someone finds out that communications are automated they stop paying attention because you stop paying attention to the communication that's a little a little nugget little little tidbit for you as well is that do not automate what you should systematize okay you can have a system around something just do not automate it because as soon as human touch is gone people stop caring about it all together and it actually withdraws goodwill from the goodwill bank account of your customers rather than depositing it's better to say nothing at all than to automate things for the most part many times i have found when it comes to customer success and getting people to believe that you give a which is kind of the point of most services okay so um the best way as a total side note of getting people to think you give a is to actually give a so with that i will leave you mosey nation keeping awesome if you're new to mozy nation welcome we love you we appreciate you keep being uh awesome we make these videos because there's a lot of broke people and i don't should be one of them um if i didn't say this at the beginning because i always forget my name is alex mosey i own acquisition.com and about 85 million a year

       " Document(page_content=\"you guys want to hear something absolutely insane I made more in a year than the CEOs of McDonald's Ford Motorola Yahoo and Ikea combined as a kid in my 20s believe me no one was more surprised than me and so I'm going to show you how to make money so fast it feels illegal the first way to make money so fast it feels illegal is to understand value creation I want to tell you a story I sent my father a picture of our largest annual event that we held in our company which licensed to gym owners um we had a room of 700 plus people and he said oh that's awesome that's so many people uh how much did they pay to be there and I said $42,000 a year and he said oh my God he said do they know that they're paying that much and I was like yeah they're aware it's not like I'm magically siphoning money from their accounts and um it was like okay uh now rather than respond and be like really you know mean about it I was like well let's walk through this I said if you were able to pay a dollar and get $5 back would you do it and he's like well it would depend I said it would depend on what he said well what's the what's the likelihood that the five to one actually happens I said that's just the average so some people are below average some people are about aage he like okay that feels like a fair bet well what would I need to do I was like great question you'd have to dedicate probably 10 plus hours a week to fully kind of implementing a new model within your business he was like okay how long would it take between when I started and when I got those types of results and I said about a year he was like okay well then yeah I think I would do it and so that thought process was kind of the first big unlock to making so much money that it should feel illegal which is that you can't sell out of your wallet you have to sell off of the value that you're creating for someone else we were able to charge significantly more and profit significantly more than everybody else in my space and so everyone else in my space was charging literally a tenth of what I was able to charge or I prefer to say command from the marketplace and the reason that was able to happen was because I Ed something called the value equation all right and so the value equation has four components and I'm not going to go super deep on it but I'll just walk you through it real quick so you've got the dream outcome which is what's the big thing that people want so in this instance it'd be they want to make more money in their gym they might want to lose weight they might want to have a fixed their relationship they might want to look cool in front of their friends whatever the next is the perceived likelihood of achievement or the equal opposite of that is risk How likely is it that when I buy this thing I get what I want which when he asked the question well How likely is it this is what he's teasing out the next question is time how long is it going to take between when I start and when I get and the longer that is the less valuable the thing is and then you have effort and sacrifice which is how hard am I going to have to try what am I going to have to start doing that I don't want to do or stop doing that I do want to do to be clear the reason that I I made this value equation is because for so long many people and you probably heard them in conent are like provide value create value but I was like what does this even mean how does one create value and so I set out to try and figure out what makes me want to buy stuff and so in a hypothetical example you'd want something that would be immediate it would be no effort it would be guaranteed and it would be exactly what they want the way they want it that would be the most valuable version of whatever you could sell and then you would say let's say that our average is $100,000 of value all right now in a B2B setting it might literally be that because it's a monetary outcome and if it's a B to C setting selling to Consumers then we have to abstract the value of what fitting back into your high school GS is worth to you or looking good on prom night or just feeling good every single day whatever but we have this Roi uh and then we have some sort of discount that we're going to apply to it which accommodates risk right one is it's in the future I would pay less for something that is uh that is guaranteed and immediate then not guaranteed and at a delay so let's say I sell tables right so this is a retail product and you get you would immediately think oh this is probably highly commoditized well I'm not so sure think about it on the lowest end you can buy a foldout plastic table from uh Lowe's or Home Depot for probably 50 or 100 bucks I haven't checked plastic table pricing recently on the flip side you can buy a $20,000 handcarved wood table both of them allow you to put stuff on top of it and eat right and so the idea is how can we position our thing separately from other people now if the dream outcome for that table is not okay I just need to have something that I could put stuff on top of the dream outcome might be when people walk into my home they feel immediately impressed so now we're actually relating this to status so this is a business because B2B is actually pretty easy it's just this is how much money it is and then the rest of your time is trying to make it easier for them less risky um and faster business consumer sometimes you need to spend a little bit more time on translating what this status increase might mean for them and how meaningful that is or the reverse how terrible and painful it's been to lack this status right and so if we have this big expensive nice table then we say okay here's the status now the risk of this not happening this is where we might show trends of this being a hot thing that many people understand the value of so the risk of them not getting the status is lowered the time is like hey I can have this at your house by the end of today that would be something like wow this could happen right in time for this dinner party I have or my boss is coming to my house and then effort and sacrifices don't worry we have a white glove service that we'll make sure that we can fit it into your doorways even though it's this massive thing and we will assemble it there for you you just need to say yes right now and it will be there by the end of the night and you can have dinner on it when you have your guest tomorrow right now we've tied them buying to all of the value components to getting them to then be willing to spend $20,000 because it's not about the wood it's not about the table it's about how much status is worth to them within this context and they get to keep it forever right and so this is how we have to unpack what we're selling so that many of you are selling tables and pricing like it's a plastic table but you're then trying to half do the work but then you can't make the margins work with the white glove because people say I only want to pay $100 like well I would deliver it and they're like oh I have to assemble this too and all of a sudden they're they're combating you when if you just had charged more and positioned it differently you could then give them all these other things that they want anyway and the reason this is so important is that price is the single largest lever on profit so let's say we've got a before all right which is that you sell your tables all right and you've got an after this obviously works for services or whatever else you sell all right and so let's say you charge $100 for your table and your cost uh for that table is uh is I'll be extreme here we'll say it's $50 okay now let's say that you have other costs like marketing and sales and other stuff like that that amounts to $30 all right so that means that your net profit is going to be 20 bucks when you sell a table gross profit is 50 net profits 20 okay now let's say that we reposition our table as this amazingly valuable thing that is now a $1,000 table okay now our cost on this the table itself might be 50 but let's say we include some of those perks let's say we've got the hand delivery uh and things like that okay well let's say that the delivery is going to be another $200 uh for one of your guys to go out there uh and and use the truck gas whatever so now we got $250 here okay okay got it and then the other costs maybe maybe your cost of uh sales goes up a little bit to sell this you got to get more leads okay so we'll call it 130 all right so now what are we actually making in net profit for this table so we got 3 380 okay I wish I had done easier math but I think it's 620 here all right so $620 in profit and so this is how you can get unreasonably wealthy in a very short period of time by simply repositioning what you sell based on the value provide someone else rather than the cost that it costs you and so to put this in context this is a 31x increase in profit and so I I'll tell you this quick story there was a guy that was in the same exact space as me that paid me for a Consulting day years ago and when I looked at his numbers what was fascinating was that he was actually selling the same amount of people per month as I was and so he was spending the same amount of marketing he was had the same number of sales guys and he was closing roughly the same amount as we were and so what what was interesting about this and this was a massive lesson that I learned is that CAC or the cost of getting a new customer in an industry as long as you're proficient at marketing more or less is actually not that different um that you'd be surprised I look at a zillion companies every year and between Industries like a local plumber and another local plumber it's not going to be that different and so the big difference though is that we were able to make somewhere in the neighborhood of about eight times uh more money per customer than this guy was but here's the crazy part we were making somewhere near of 50 times more profit and it's because of this so we had eight times more money but then it resulted in so remember this is just this is a 10x right so this is a 10x increase in price but it resulted in a 31x increase in profit and so this is why price is such a strong lever on how much you make now where it gets competitive is if somebody else can do something just like you and do it for less but there was a I think a Mackenzie survey where they looked at uh a number of companies and 85% of them competed on price and only 1% of them won on price so it's literally the worst possible strategy you can have because there's only one person who wins lowest price Dan Kennedy said this famously there's no reward you get for being the second cheapest competitor you just lose a lot of money right and so there is however a benefit to being the most expensive person and that's going to be a direct correlation to the amount of value that you can provide any individual person and so again it's about thinking how much is this worth and then can I deliver it to them and can I eliminate the risk make it faster and make it easier for them so that I can get less discount on the value that I think it can provide that person now the 2011 version of this is selling out of their future Wallet not today's wallet and then the ways that we pull apart that value so let's say it's a $100,000 of value there's going to be a discount that's going to be apply to that $100,000 based on How likely it is which is the risk it's going to be based on how long it's going to take which is the time it's going to be how how easy it is how much work they're going to have to put in and then fundamentally the dream outcome which if they want to make more money that one's clear now if you have a b Toc business a business consumer business then you have to translate what looking amazing On Prom Night means to someone financially or how much pain they've been in for not having the specific solution in their life and so if I buy stuff and it gets to me faster I'm willing to pay more for it if someone I buy stuff and they guarantee it or they make it risk-free or they show me tons of proof I'm more likely to pay for it and pay more for it if someone says oh you don't have to do anything versus you have a ton of work associated with it I'm more willing to pay for it and then the dream outcome is just making sure that I actually want this thing versus something else and so this actually operationalizes what we can do as business owners how do we make it faster how do we make it easier how do we make it risk-free and deliver it the way they want it so that was the first of the three kind of beliefs that I had to break in order to make crazy money in my 20s the second way to make money so fast it feels illegal is to sell in a fast cash conversion cycle if you don't know what that is I'll explain it right now this is what allowed me to have $1,000 in my bank account in December of 2016 I had a th000 bucks in my bank account after losing everything for the second time uh actually that was the first time I lost everything and then I lost everything again I think three months later so just figuratively imagine I didn't have a lot of money now 10 months later I was able to put in $10 million in sales and bake I think something probably close to Six Million in profit all right now here's the crazy part is that how can you get this to equate to $10 million in such a short period of time well the first thing is we got 100 to1 return on our advertising and so every dollar that I put in so I put I put $1,000 in ads I made $100,000 and then I put that $100,000 into ads and I made 10 million and that is fundamentally what happened and so the constraint of the business no longer was acquisition but the reason that was not the constraint meaning it wasn't the thing that blocked me from growing was that we had figured out something that I call client finan acquisition which is just a fancy way of saying using your customers money as a loan to get more customers so let me explain so if someone walks into your business right today and let's say it cost you $100 in marketing to get them to buy something from you all right just keep it really simple so it cost me $100 to get this guy now let's say that my thing costs $100 okay now you think oh I grw even but that thing just like the table is not going to be 100% margin not likely and so if it's like the table then I only make plus 50 on this but I minus 100 because I had to pay this 100 to get them in the door so I'm actually 50 right now for my first transaction now should I do this transaction um unless I have something else to sell not really because it means I'm spending 100 to make 50 bad deal now if this person's going to spend three or four more times over the next however many months then yeah it's a good idea but it's still going to take me time and I'm still going to to lose money up front now for me to do this whole thing I got to do it a different way and so this kind of enters the new way of doing things which is I would acquire the customer for $100 same guy right now he's smaller for whatever reason um and this time I say okay how can I get this guy to not only pay for himself that's point one that's breaking EV on getting customers but point two is I need to get him to be able to buy me my next customer and so if I know my next customer is also going to be $100 then it means I want him to pay himself back so I need 100 all right then I need my next customer so I need another 100 and then I need to make sure I get my my cost of my table back which is 50 all right so I need to make $250 uh on this transaction for me to then be able to use this dollars to then go get my next customer and then I repeat this process over and over and over again and then that result in this massive amount of money because if you had a machine that for every dollar you put into it you got a $100 back out what would your marketing budget be it would be everything you had and so here's the crazy part is that this these types of returns pretty much only exist in businesses like this type of Arbitrage which is why if you look at the wealthiest people in the world they own assets they own businesses that generate cash flow because the most significant Arbitrage that exists is what it cost to get somebody to buy something from you and if you have a well-designed business how much you can make from that person and so think about this as every business is a little mini investing machine and so you pay X to get customers uh you get y dollars back and then instead of waiting a year for 10% improvements on the S&P 500 you can wait one day and get a $100 back and so why would you invest in anything else well the richest people in the world don't they're highly concentrated in the businesses and industries that they understand well and so this concept of clent finest acquisition was the big unlock that I had and I have in four times in my life have I gone through what I would consider a wealth warp where I had a material change in my net worth in a very short period of time and most of the money that I've made has been in short periods of time and then followed by kind of like level sets for a while then I figure out something else and then I get a huge step up in income so if you're you're like man we've been stuck for a while you're usually just this far away from figure out what that constraint is now it could have been capital so for me I didn't have any money and so this solved my Capital constraint now what did did not solve it didn't solve my people constraint it didn't solve my you know hiring didn't solve didn't solve uh didn't solve you know keyman R I didn't solve any of those problems but it gave me enough cash to be able to solve those problems in the future so let me put this in perspective for you my weight loss business which was my my actual gyms which are called United Fitness all right United Fitness I was able to open up a new location every 6 months off of the cash flow no money out of pocket using this exact same process and so I would put $5,000 down I would sign a lease I would begin spending money on Advertising like $100 a day and for every $100 that I would spend I would get somewhere in the neighborhood of $2500 to $3,000 back immediately and so in the first week I would then order the equipment and the next week I would order the flooring and the next week I would set up the lobby and get the painting done and by the fourth week IID made around $100,000 which is roughly what it cost to open the business and give me six weeks of payroll so that by the end of the promotion that I was selling which was a six week challenge at the time I would have something they have 20 or $30,000 of recurring Revenue at that gym but it cost me almost no money out of pocket because I let my customers pay for my gym for me I would say I will spend $5 a lead close one out of five leads on a $500 thing and so I would pay 25 bucks to get a customer and make 500 back and then I would take the rest of that to go get another 25 spend another $25 to get another customer get another 500 and then that's how I was able to to finance the growth of the gyms and that's how at 23 years old and then 24 and then 25 it was six locations and again the constraint was no longer cash it was trainers it was managers it was salespeople that's what limited my growth this was the first time I discovered this concept and then I was like oh man I should do this again and so then I started gym launch 1.0 which is where I flew out from location to location and I would make $100,000 at the gym but then I didn't have to pay for the buildout and I didn't have to manage the gym afterward so I could just take $100,000 it was just me with a little fold out table probably $100 from lows um and then just a stack of contracts and I have videos of me going through just random places and selling all day every day for 21 days straight and then eventually I taught that system to other people but the average amount that I'd spend in advertising in those markets was somewhere there of like1 to $5,000 and I would make upwards of $100,000 in that first month and so this is what allowed me to go from again zero to doing 32 plus launches in like 18ish months now the third time that this wealth Alchemy occurred for me was when gym launch transitioned to licensing now in the licensing business this is when things got even Wilder because I had fewer operational constraints to scale and so here I had to keep scaling more and more sales guys because I had to fly them out which was actually a tough value proposition for them they apparently had wife and kids that wanted to see them go figure um and so when I switched to licensing which was just showing people how I was filling these gyms that's where we went from the0 to $10 million in sales in 10 months all right that's what's that's almost crazier in my opinion than the second the second full year of business we did we did around 16 million in iida all right that means profit all right and we did 26 million TopLine in revenue and again this is coming from somebody who had then lost it all because I have made some bad bets in my life and you're like okay well it must have only been a fluke that time well the next business I started was Prestige Labs which is our supplement company when from zero 1.7 million per month this was at the launch this was month one all right and then I had Allen which Allen went from zero to 1.7 million per month weirdly that it was the same number um in six months so these types of numbers only can occur when you remove capital or money as a way of scaling as a thing that blocks you if you had unlimited money which if you set up the way that you acquire customers correctly you can if you think this video helped you make more money or would help someone else make more money it would mean the world to me if you shared it as a DM or send it to them as a text so they could watch it and get the benefits too and Associate those benefits with you so what you really want that math to work out to is that you want two times CAC plus cogs to equal 30-day cash collected all right uh which is basically gross profit so you're like okay that sounds like a really complex equation I'll say it in in plain English you want to make two times as much as it cost you to get a customer and deliver on that customer within 30 days based on the amount of cash that you generate from them in excess of the cogs right and so if we have let's say $100 remember to get the customer and then $50 of cogs right then we want to make sure that we can have $300 I actually did the math wrong before this is why equations are useful right we want to make sure we make $300 on that first customer so that in the the first 30 days and you're like why is he thinking about 30 days the reason I'm so obsessive about 30 days is because that is the amount of time that anybody can get interest rate free cash and so everybody has access to a credit card and it doesn't matter what your limit is even if it's a $500 limit that you start out with which is typically what they'll start most people on a $500 limit guess what you can do you pay it off tomorrow and so if you can get it within that period of time you'll only be limited by that card now if you can do it in seven days then you can repeat the cycle uh four times in a month if you can do it every day then you repeat it 30 times in a month right and so very quickly based on your speed of collecting the cash back which is called the cash conversion cycle you can accelerate your growth I honestly think the reason that most businesses don't do this is because they believe a narrative that because other people in the industry don't do it they can't and I think that that belief keeps many business owners poor the amount of businesses that I've we've gone into and been like uh okay well let's just get people to prepay 3 months at a time they're like no we it's industry standard to to do services and then collect a net net 60 and I'm like yeah well that's their standard we don't have to do that well why don't we just give them incentive to pay and they're like w well what if what I'm like what if what what if they say no well they say they're saying no today sometimes too might as well like collect more when we do it and then we say hey we we happen to build quarterly and with that convenience we also give you a 5% discount which of course we baked into the price anyways right or we add some sort of onboarding process that normally people might charge separately for or that we add in so that we can collect more cash up front and I'm willing to give a significant amount of things up front so that I don't have my cost of getting customers as anything that gets in the way of me growing a business I never want my ability to get customers or money to get them to be the thing that limits my growth and I think that's the reason that all these businesses that I just explained went from zero to million plus per month within a year and I'm saying within a year as a sof most of them within 6 months if you want to make more money ask to get paid sooner so think about this so if you if you are uh a minimum wage employee right then you do work and then you get paid afterwards at a delay right now if you're a contractor sometimes uh you can do work and get paid but usually you get paid and then you do work if you're a surgeon you get paid and then months pass and then you do the surgery if you're an insurance company you get paid and then you may not have to ever work at all and if you're the church you get paid off of someone's income their Topline a royalty that goes straight to the church now royalties happen the same way leans do so if you if someone owes you money you can take a lean off the top you skim off the top and so basically your position in What's called the capital stack is predicated on your leverage in the situation and so if it's up to you you might as well choose to get paid sooner now you might be looking at this and thinking yeah but how do I get all of that cash up front how do I get people to actually spend more money with me faster well it comes down to one you can either raise the price of your thing or two you get people to buy more stuff immediately and so one of the big misconception business owners have is that they're afraid of making offers and so I want to be very clear you don't want to try and force someone to do something people don't like to be sold but they do love buying right I mean think about how much money Amazon makes people love buying and so what we want to do is make offers when it's convenient for them to take them and so an offer only doesn't work if it's something that they don't want or you present it at the wrong time or you know advanced verion 3 they don't it's not being delivered in the way they want it to be delivered all right and I'll tell you a quick story about that so when I was in the in the weight loss business we discovered that there were some customers that would come in and they didn't want to buy gym services and I was like okay well that's lame but I then figured out hey why don't I in invite them to a nutrition seminar and so we invite them to nutrition seminar even though they said no to our services think how crazy this is they come in virgy we try to sell them they say no I say hey can I just help you with your food and they say sure then they go to the nutrition seminar and they buy more than the people who bought gym services on average and so I was like oh we just needed to make them a different offer to solve the same problem so they wanted to lose weight still they just didn't feel like sweating they wanted to take supplements and eat differently fine so learning to make multiple offers to a customer is not only beneficial for them because you help them solve the problem in more ways it's also beneficial for you because you get more cash up front and so thinking through how do I get someone to buy because there's something that people enter called a hyper buying cycle so if someone makes any kind of new decision especially if it's like okay I'm now somebody who's going to start taking care of their lawn hey I'm I just bought this new car hey I I'm going to run a marathon there's these little cycles that people enter there's these buying windows and what a traditional business owner would say let's say somebody who runs a marathon they they sign up for the marathon and then they go to The Running Store when they go to The Running Store they have to buy some shoes now the store owner says oh I don't want to offer them you know fancy socks or an i iPod wristband or new tank tops I don't want I don't want to seem like I'm being pushy but what are they going to do they're still going to go buy that stuff because they have to get the whole thing and so there's this natural problem solution cycle that continues over and over and over again within every customer's purchases provided the first problem is solved with the first purchase and then that then opens up the next problem so once you have your shoes what else do you need you're going to need socks once you have socks what else you're going to need you're going to need shorts once you have shorts what else you going need you need tank top that doesn't you know rub on your on your your underarms you're also going to need an iPod carrier all of these different things you're also going to want the number thing you might want a coach you might want an app you might want a hydration thing like there's there's supplements there's all these different things that stem from this and everyone's afraid to ask so just make the offer available and if they choose not no worries if you're like if you go buy something and then the thank you page says hey would you want this too if you're offended by that well the business doesn't really care I put it that way because other people won't be offended by it and will be happy that you made it available and more can convenient for them so ultimately you're providing more value and you're getting rewarded for it yeah and and at each one of these uh upsells that you might want to include you still think through each of the value equation components so you still think what's the dream outcome they ultimately want how do I make it risk-free for them how do I do it faster and how do I make it easier so number one we're charging as much as we possibly can because we're doing it based on value not based on cost the second thing we're doing is we're structuring our economics of the business how we upsell how we down sell so we can generate more cash in the first 30 days so that we can get enough to pay for this customer and the next customer and delivering for both of them in that same time period so that cash and getting customers is not limited the business and the third way to make money so fast it feels illegal is to understand wealth Alchemy and ignore taxes or kind of just play the game the right way so let me walk you through an example so let's say that you give away free trials of your thing okay cool makes sense we give away free trials and let's say a free trial of your thing cost $100 to get someone to start fine now let's also for simple math say the trial is $100 per month all right we'll keep this really simple all right that's the price that's our free trial after the conversion okay now let's say that we get uh one out of uh three people who start a free trial to become a customer okay that means that it's going to cost us $300 right this times three to get a customer okay now let's say that we know one out of three customers becomes a permanent customer meaning once they get on our subscription they never leave which would mean that our permanent CAC is somewhere close to $900 okay now if our price here is $100 a month then that means that the annual revenue Anor recurring revenue is $1,200 per year okay so we pay $900 to make $1,200 per year Well if you had a stock that you could buy for $900 and then it and then it sent you back $1,200 um within 12 months you probably be like that's a great investment now if it kept doing that you'd be like it's unbelievable investment well let me show you how much more wild this can really get now let's say that we have this let's just say this is a software company all right so if it's a software company let's say that it trades at 10 times Topline which is fairly typical for like a B2B SAS business as long as you have good retention metrics which is why this is so important permanent CAC permanent customer so if we know that then it means that we're actually making $122,000 in Enterprise Value which means how valuable the business is that can create this kind of money now here's where it gets even nastier is that this is tax-free and so you get paid this money but you also get this it's not either or it's an and so when I figured this out I was like oh this is how people just make stupid money really fast and so let's let's work this out okay I want to make $120 million let's say that was my goal okay so $120 million I would have to how many $112,000 customers in terms of Enterprise Value would I need well let's go look all right so I need 10,000 customers of this of this $900 times 10,000 to get my $120 million Enterprise Value here so let me ask you a question does 10,000 time 900 so you're telling me if I pay $9 million I can make this year an increase of a 120 million in asset value taxfree and and make $12 million in Revenue that I add for the 9 million and so walk through this in sequence with me you spend 9 million you get back $12 million in annual revenue and that $12 million of annual revenue is worth1 120 million that you paid zero taxes on that is the game this is the wealth Alchemy this is how it works this is how these software companies that IPO at three billion how in four years it goes from you know nothing right to a multi-billion dollar thing if you look at how much it cost them to get customers you're like like when I understood this I was like oh it's literally just a massive Arbitrage between the permanent cost of acquiring customers relative to the annual value relative to the Enterprise Value multiple and then those three things spit together is what creates this massive discrepancy between what you put in and what you get out which because of my fancy fancy t-shirt here I will show you is the definition of Leverage and so the reason that there are two symbols that are woven into the acquisition. comom logo which is supply and demand and a full Chrome for leverage is that you get more for what you put in and so if you have two businesses right so let's let's let's paint this out let's say we had a different business that we did the same thing but let's say that we actually these types of businesses whatever business it was traded on bottom line and so if the business uh was doing 12 million let's say that it's doing $3 million in profit whatever this new other business is okay it's doing $ million in profit and let's say that we get a uh 7x multiple on the on this uh on this eida which is fancy word for profit which means that we have $21 million now if I paid 9 million for 21 million would I be down for that probably I mean it's still a 2 point something X it's not bad but this is why picking a good opportunity vehicle because in both of these situations you still spent the $900 per customer you still make the $1,200 per year but the big difference was how much is that $1,200 per year worth yeah and so let's dive into this permanent customer concept for a second this concept took me so long to grasp as an entrepreneur what every business owner needs to focus on is how do I not lose customers and the reason for that is that let's compare two businesses all right so let's say you've got business a and business B okay so business a acquires 100 customers your one and loses 100 customers and the next year they double their acquisition they double their marketing and sales they acquire 200 customers and then year three they you know they lose all 200 and then they they they add another 50% acquisition they do 300 customers in year three okay so it's a 300 customer business now Company B sells 100 first year now second year they do aund they keep their first 100 but they don't increase their marketing and sales so now they have 100 from last year plus 100 to this year and then the third year they have 100 from two years ago 100 from one year ago and then 100 this year both of these businesses A and B have 300 customers but which company would you rather own this one absolutely no question so why is that you want time to be on your side not your enemy because time is going to pass no matter what and you want a business where no matter what happens it just keeps growing so you can sell the same amount of customers you could even not sell customers and still make money and so this is a far less risky business and as a result of that if you recall the value equation from earlier an investor is valuing a business fundamentally on the same things which is How likely is this to occur how much effort and sacrifice is this going to take what is the time delay between now and when this becomes this ultimate thing right and so the same process is still done obviously at a slightly more complex scale but when we're thinking about permanent customers this companies is turning customers into permanent customers company a is just a churn Factory they sell something want and people don't like it and they leave which means the only way to grow this business is market and sell more but that is only a oneway road at some point you sell through all the customers within a given base and so it would behoove us to spend more time just figuring out how to not lose people so that 10 years from now what like as we keep going because this this map would continue this guy is going to slow down right it being able to double Marketing sales every single year is tough but just keeping the customers you had for 10 years significantly easier but people don't focus on because it's not as sexy but this is where the real leverage occurs and this is where that wealth alchemy that I was referencing earlier this is how you get stupid RIT and so let me give you a real word example so Starbucks do you want to know what their LTV per customer is $114,000 that's how much they make per customer and that is why Starbucks makes so much money so you think about these like high ticket businesses and stuff that's all around B2B whatever they're making $14,000 per customer from like everyone and so what does it cost to get somebody to to buy a cup of coffee I promise you significantly less than $14,000 and this relates back to my very first point that I was telling you where I had another company that was in the same space as me the cost to get a customer for Starbucks to get somebody buy coffee is probably similar to a Dunkin Donut it's probably similar to another random you know coffee shop down the street the difference is that they had engineered their model such that people wanted to keep coming back that they became recurring or reoccurring customers so the difference there really quickly is recurring means it's a subscription like netflex reoccurring means that you buy on a regular basis so you might buy Coca-Cola for example or whatever one of their products that you like you're probably not on a subscription for it but you buy it when you're out at restaurants or you buy it when you ship it to your house whatever or you just buy Costco when you're there from a distribution center either way you are a reoccur customer for them and so figuring out what is my cost of a permanent customer and all you have to do is figure because a lot of businesses have this is you say okay let's say you're an agency a super high- turn business typically okay there are some customers that have been with you for a long time and we will I will consider somebody who's been with you two plus years as a permanent customer within the context of what we're talking about now you might figure out and this is why this is so important that there it's only one out of every 10 of your customers becomes a permanent customer well then you say okay well how much does it cost to get a customer multiply it by 10 this is actually the recurring base that we're trying to build everyone else is just sifting through the you know the weat from the the the shaft I think is what it's called Uh to get the just get the kernels right the main the main part and if you want to be smarter about it you can say huh well it takes us 10 customers to get these ones but what if these customers look and smell walk and talk a little bit differently than the other nine well I'll bet you if we changed our advertising and attracted only those types of customers we would be able to get a higher hit rate on that so even if our CAC for this specific Avatar doubles but we get it to one out of three it cost us $600 to get a customer rather than $1,000 and we're still winning overall and so so the big picture here is that number one we have to sell off a value we have to use the value equation to make things less risky faster and easier for the customers once we do that we are decoupled from a race to the bottom price War number two once we know what our premium prices we want to pull that cash forward and speed up the cash conversion cycle so that capital or money is not the limiter of the business and so we can get customers on demand and we can do so profitably we're literally getting paid to get new customers they pay us they finance our acquisition which why I call it customer Finance acquisition and then finally we understand the game of wealth Alchemy which is of the customers that we acquire what percentage of them become permanent customers and they become the reoccurring Revenue base within this business and then that reoccurring base is what we are going to be valued on and then what is that value multiple and so then we just look at the Arbitrage between what it costs us to get a permanent customer versus what our Enterprise Value multiple is going to be which is until the day you sell it growing taxfree and so I'll show you one last little hack here that I think is important so let's just say in this business it's in the original vehicle so you can just forget about this little side Stu so it's in the original vehicle and let's say that we've got $3 million in profit for this business it doesn't matter okay so you have three million bucks in profit in this business and let's say that you live in a high tax state and you get tax 50% for tax reasons so you're going to take home $1.5 million after taxes now you're butt hurt about this cuz you're like what the heck government you're taking half of what I made but if you added $12 million to the business and you spent this money to do that what did you really increase well you increased your personal net worth by $120 million and so if you had1 120 million plus the 3 million that you made in cash flow and you only had to pay 1.5 million on 123 now you're paying I don't know 1 .5% in taxes when I realized this it fundamentally shifted how I played the game I I I I was really obsessed with tax strategy and trying to maximize all these loopholes when the biggest and most obvious one is just build something valuable and as long as you keep building it and you don't want to cash it out all of that growth is taxfree and compounds and the the the clue that I got on this was realizing I was like this is before Elon moved from California so I was like elon's in California I was like Zuckerberg is in California and I looked at the the Forbes list said all these people in the US were in California but I was like but California has the highest taxes how is this possible I was like oh they understand something about wealth creation that I don't understand what is that and that was when I dove deep and understood this level of wealth creation or what I like to call now wealth Alchemy if you like this video you'll love these\",

       " Document(page_content=\"mosey nation what is going on in this video what i want to talk to you about is a hot take that i had on people who complain that their business is not growing enough and yet see everything as though people owe them something and so i uh did two videos or three videos a week for three years and you know everyone you know you have some bombs you have some great videos and this is the among the top one percent of videos that i made in terms of the number of people who shared it liked it commented all that stuff and it was in a private community and i want to make it public to you guys and so uh this video uh truly will show you the frame of mind and the perspective from which to see customer success increasing lifetime value how to ultimately provide more value than everyone else does from a framing perspective and it applies to sex it applies to business and it applies to life and this is one of the hottest take videos you see if i share any numbers in the video it's because it was in the past that's why if you see a discrepancy that's the difference so anyways mostly nation there's a lot of people broke i don't want to be one of them that's why i make these videos keep being awesome i'll see you guys in it enjoy what's up everybody happy saturday ah man i've got a good one for you today i um this is even one where i looked at layla and i was like i'm gonna have to take a walk on this one um this kind of came to me and i was thinking about it and it's just like man it's it's it's this one kind of philosophy so we have we have five five core tenants at gym lunch rather than go through all of them i'll tell you one of them is and it's uh own it that's one of the five core tennis that we have and if you are curious about what why you would have those you make core tenants so that you can always reference them back for yourself um and for the employees that you have so you can say like this is how we make decisions right and you can always look back at that and be like this is who we are right so own it is one of them and oh man this is so good a lot of people get really upset about their customers who sign for a 12-month membership and then quit after three months right and i'll hear the same people trying to get out of franchise agreements that are five years long right and saying this is bs i haven't gotten the value they didn't give me what they promised they would give me right i'm being real talk and so one of the things and one of the ways that we've so we have honest ridiculously ridiculously like almost zero churn on our highest level group so our most expensive group we basically zero turn and if you were to tell like if you were to ask anyone or someone ask us like how are you growing this that how are you going this fast all this stuff is that honestly i think it's just because i'm incredibly insecure deep down and i have this huge fear of rejection so i don't want anyone to not like me and i don't want anyone to feel like i'm not giving them what i what i said i was going to give them and it's like it's a serious fear of mine probably rooted in security if you can shift your perspective from thinking from well i just got the contract we're done to like we just got the contract oh now we have to fulfill on this right the way i see my relationship with the gym lords group i see it as a week to week like you guys are on week to week with me unless i perform unless i provide value like everyone's gonna leave right now obviously you need to be discerning you need to be wise you need to protect yourself with contract that goes without saying obviously right and you have agreements that are there but if you ever rely on your business because of contracts you will lose always because at the end of the day people will do what they want to do if you rely on contracts your life will be living hell because then people are like well if you like you trick me know like if you live on contracts your life is going to be about contracts and how about you i don't want my life to be about contracts right you can go even deeper with this okay so when like i married layla i honestly had this feeling we both had a conversation like literally the day like the night of our marriage and i was like i was like i was like we can't mess this up i was like this is it i was like you're the one i committed to if anything i was like i was like i like i just don't it's like if we ever have issues i was like we gotta confront immediately because we're in this right if you treat your marriage right you've got that contract you're like i got a contract you got to be with me right and you treat your marriage like you treat your customers i got a contract you have to stay here you have to pay me you will lose and if life will suck but if you consider it as week to week like i consider us day to day and i used to make that joke when we were dating people like are you guys committed like in a relationship this is right before your married i was like we're month to month [Laughter] she hated it but the joke for me served the fact that like you're only as good as your last paycheck right you're only as good as your last day and the moment you rest on your laurels the moment you get lazy is the moment someone else who's hungrier will take you right and that could be someone who's hungry who takes your wife now obviously we have commitments we have shared principles that we never want like we believe in i don't get biblical on you but like like we believe when you get married you stay married right that's like that's the goal that you can always make it work with anyone right that's our belief that was one of the things that we checked on each other before we got married right but that being said if you look at what the bible says right and this is just marriage but the marriage and business are so similar because you have to do the stuff sometimes you don't want to do and you got to be consistent you got to do it every day you can't just say hey great job this week and then not say anything for two months to your customers right same thing with the marriage i can't just be like hey babe thanks for making dinner once a month and she makes dinner every single day right and she crushes it she's awesome layla is a freak she's amazing if i could run our business away well she kind of runs her business but the point is if you're losing customers and you're like all these people are flaky no one commit no one like and you want to get into victim mindset of like lamenting customers right they're people and people will always be self-serving you can always count on it i had a mentor telling me that he's like if you always predict that people will act in their own self-interest he's like you'll always be right and i've always thought about that i was like wow he's like you want to predict the future protect them predict that they will act in their own self-interest forget what they say about principles forget what they say about anything and so what you want to do if you like which is why you should always align relationships so that how their best interest is with you right so like i have to make legacy so freaking good that their best interest is staying and paying me right i'm being super real with you and so if your customers right at your gym keep leaving and you keep saying no one's like no one honors their word anymore no one does any like bs man like you probably didn't honor your word right because you're no longer in their best interest anymore and they tell you that by leaving right by having high churn rates that's how they tell you that that's how the market tells you that you're not being good enough right and so despite you despite signing the 12-month contract or about signing the 18-month contract whatever it is live week-to-week live workout to workout because the real contract that they have with you is for today and the moment that one of your employees gives them lip or says something or says something rude or doesn't show up on time or the bathroom looks like or their music is the same playlist they've heard every single time they go to your gym they're gonna leave that's it they'll come up with their reason they'll say they got busy they'll you know like work or they're moving they'll come up their friend's a doctor or a nurse they'll get the fake note it doesn't matter someone wants to leave the relationship to leave if your wife wants to cheat on you she'll find a way so you don't want that so it's like i gotta make this so good that you don't want to look anywhere else you think you'd be crazy to look anywhere else right and they've been like i want i want my wife to go out and like someone's like if some guy's like hey like you know come on she's like do you know what i have at home like like you're a fool you know i mean if you think that that's gonna get me right like your game is so low you have no idea what i have right so they see a gym advertisement for something else they're like you have no idea my gym like you have no idea how my trainers treat me you have no idea how i feel when i walk into that gym every day right how those people can make me feel and so if you think about your relationship with your customers as you're only as good as yesterday you're only as good as today that's it that's all you've got and so every time you have to resell them like i sell layla every single day on being with me every single day because i love her to death and i want i want this to be awesome forever i do and i know that i know that in order for that to happen i can't just appreciate her once a week i can't even appreciate her once a day i tell her every like every moment baby i love you i'm like you're awesome you're so good i was like you managed our team so well i could never do this without you and it's true right and so if you look no here's another one ready for it you've got your employees everybody's got their employees everybody complains about their employees my employees don't work hard enough they don't care about my customers they don't care well how are you showing up as a leader how invested are you in them do they feel like my trainer left with all my customers they left with that they left with because it was so bad with you that they had to look somewhere else it was so bad that they had to leave and so it's like how how can i make this exchange fair exchange how can i make this exchange even abundant exchange as in they get more than what they get from i i give more than i get right how can i make this an unfair advantage that's how you have a value discrepancy value discrepancies keep people people are like people don't go to chipotle because it's worth seven dollars people go to chipotle because they pay seven and they get a 20 meal that's why they go to chipotle that's the secret i'm all about raising prices but i'm all about being 10 times more valuable than my price which is three times more expensive than everyone else and never ever ever ever ever taking it for granted i don't take your attention for granted i don't take the fact that you pay us every week for granted because i know that there's always somebody who's going to come after me and try and be better than us and i have crazy insecurity um in thinking that like tomorrow it could all be over and i never want that to happen and so um if you think about that with your customers you will always be ahead of your competition like we're constantly innovating because i'm like everyone's gonna copy my stuff everyone's gonna copy the stuff i came up with last month i gotta make new stuff i gotta make new stuff right and when you're when i'm concentrating on my customers and not my competition right then i make good right because i want them to stay and i'm thinking i'm only as good as my last paycheck right i'm only i can only provide for layla if i provide for you stuff that makes you money for real anyways so this was a walk and talker i thought i would uh just give you a little little saturday morning love as i get some fresh air in socal enjoy soak in some of the the socal weather but i love you guys so if you guys don't have amazing marriage amazing business amazing relationship with your customers amazing relationship with your employees don't ever think about what you've done because they don't people don't humans don't right we don't remember what we did we don't remember all those things like every time i can't tell you how many times my wife is taking the trash out i always remember when i take it out right we always remember what we do but we forget what everyone else does and we forget that they forget what we did and we think that it's wrong that they forgot when in fact we just have to do more again today right because you can't change anything else and i can't change how they're going to think and so you can either lament how human beings are or you can react and win and just adjust right you can just adjust so all you got to do is just know that everyone's going to forget no one will honor their vows and if you think about life that way you will never be surprised in business if people leave you then take it as a sign i'm doing something wrong right if there's some you know discontent in the marriage take it as a science and be like she doesn't appreciate me think about how i can appreciate her more right how can i make things better for her so that she wants to stay right so she gets excited she like she doesn't want like she's no energy anymore like okay cool why don't we have energy why don't i make her dinner once you know what i mean or what like whatever whatever that person's love language is i'm not get too deep in like on the marriage side but like you got to fill their needs customers and employees too like especially especially since we're selling service most of us are selling service and if you're selling service you need to fulfill the person's needs otherwise they're not going to fulfill the needs of your customers right are you investing in them do you want them to grow are you giving them the things that they need to move on and become rock stars so anyways i love you guys i hope you guys having an amazing amazing day and weekend hope you found this valuable as always thank you very much for your attention i know that you have many things to spend your attention and eyeballs on and i'm honored that you decided

       " Document(page_content=\"so if you doubled Revenue across all of these you'd already be at five and that's probably about 6 months of work yeah yeah so this is Raymond he's a chiropractor does $5 million a year and this is Alex I'm an investor and I make all the money that I have a golden share with diamonds that I sit on at bed and I just count how much money I have and the point of today is I'm going to try and help Raymond take his chain to the next level hey Alex uh my name is Raymond coer I'm the founder of Kyo first of Washington so just a little bit above my business uh we currently have six brick and mortar locations trilling 12 months Revenue 5.2 million uh you better have around roughly 1.2 million and our net profit is about 23% do you buy those or did you open up uh organic so far I've bought all of them oh really okay yeah but I think moving forward we're going to change our strategy a little bit so overall the company's doing well 5.2 million 23% margin healthy I was curious whether he opened them organically or he bought them because there's basically two big expansion strategy either buy or you build and so he chose a buy strategy that initial kind of sorting told me okay these are the types of questions and problems I need to look out for as he goes through the rest of the presentation so what's the goal my three-year goal is to try to get to $5 million Eva um I want to try to build a business that can run individually but then I also want to entertain um selling to an Institutional buyer so this is very much a prity what we talk about so when someone says they're trying to build it to sell it versus build it to keep it I see both of those as basically the same path it just shows how much they want to work like super longterm either way all paths lead to building a better business so who do you help specifically our key demographic that we help is 35 to 65y old men and women uh that have some kind of condition that we can help with whether it's pain discomfort or lots of movement insurance or cash we're about 75% Insurance oh interesting okay how do you help them so the way we help them is uh when when someone comes into our office uh we'll design a custom treatment plant for them that might be over a period of 60 to 90 days uh it might include chiropactic rehab and spinal decompression right so spinal decompression kind of differentiates us from a lot of our competitors because it's a niche service that we offer um for people that have disc related injuries is that like stretching people out kind of thing yeah okay exactly well how do you make money our offer so basically on the front end uh we offer a free consultation so then when the patient comes in our packages can range from 2400 to 3600 uh over a 60 to 90day period we're primarily a reoccurring Revenue model mhm and roughly one out of every seven of our patients they come in for a larger case value so like a car accident or work injury might be worth up to $10,000 well right off the bat I think the reason that he's been able to expand is that making a decent amount of money and so typical you know chiropractors who don't know business will sell one crack at the back at a time uh whereas he's already selling High ticket packages which is the right direction to go for you know a premium service and he obviously has a super premium with this whole kind of insurance $10,000 thing and so it's like right off the bat his price points are right what's what's advertising how do you find him for paid advertising the number one is Facebook ads so we spend about 1,000 bucks per location on that uh the second one is Google ads so we're spending roughly 500 to a th000 per month on on each location okay got it uh so what's sales velocity how many do you sell per month on average we're we're getting about 35 leads uh per month um and out of the 35 we have 28 that show okay it's pretty good and so we have a show rate about 80% that's great um and our closing rate is about 71% so total sales probably roughly around 20 cool solid numbers so right off the bat Raymond's got really strong show rates exceptionally strong close rates and mind you this is one location so we'll see if that's system one which then on some part of my mind I'm like okay when you have super high close rates like that we might need to bump prices like it just shows that the market is willing to spend more and so for me like I would say healthy close rate percentage is usually like 30 to 40% that's kind of like usually where you find The Sweet Spot of price versus number of units sold not always but that tends to be like rule of thumb but by and large it shows that he knows how to get people to shop and he knows how to close what's stay in the way what's the problem if I were to to uh prioritize my constraints what I think they are uh number one I would say is probably lead flow I think that we could do better in that department it's not consistent okay when I had one location it was really easy to predict that and to to change the outcome pretty quickly but as we've scaled i' I'm having a tougher and tougher time to um you know scale the marketing what Raven's dealing with is super common when you go from one location to multiple especially if it's purchased let alone you know organically grown because usually I call it founder magic or owner magic it's like if you have one location it's like your thumb print's on it like your heartbeats on it everybody knows you they they kind of grw up with you everyone kind of knows your Vibe you have old customers who remember you and so it's like always going to be special and different than everyone that you open after that because you're typically just not nearly as entrenched second one would be like our sales infrastructure because we are 75% insurance-based there's so many different plans out there right so we have to when the patient comes in we have to determine what kind of insurance they have by verifying it and then make a customized plan based off of that so if there's a way to to uh streamline that into one day I think it'll be much more effective for us what I personally practiced I was able to do it in one day but I'm having I'm having a tough time training my doctors to be able to do that okay and then uh people operations people operation so obviously when I had one location it was really easy to control the standard right uh but as we expand it's harder and harder to have that same standard okay so let's see the numbers so going over the numbers again so top line revenue 5.2 million last fall months profit 1.2 net margin is about 23% okay um our CAC is about 700 our lifetime value is 3,400 so that's 4.8 to1 um LTB to co ratio uh marketing spend we're spending about 1,500 to 2,000 per location right now the sh rate's 80% close rate 71% and our annual ad spend on marketing is about 110,000 so right off the bat obviously the numbers are really strong the amount that he's spending per location seems low given how much money he's making so I think there's probably opportunity there but I'm just very curious how it actually breaks down between locations because that'll probably give us more insight huh okay do you have any anything broken out between channels between Facebook and Google so this is our our Facebook data um I was able to put together like our our 12-month uh numbers for all the clinics for as okay and then for as far as the the challenge that we have is because we're Insurance based we don't get paid for like 30 60 90 days after so I had to go back and I picked Q2 for three clinics yeah yeah okay um so these are the numbers for for uh for those three clinics in quarter do so looking at this whole sheet I scanned it and then the bottom where you can see Q2 there it's Capitol Hill Everett and Kent and so Kent you see an eight Raz there so that was really strong the lowest CAC by a decent margin and so I wanted to understand whether that was a performance thing or like it just costs less because of a marketpl cost per impression cpms are lower there there might just be more people I wanted to double click into that to figure out why that one's doing so much better than the others okay so why is Kent so much better is the dock there different than the other docks they're about the no's he's he's good but he's he's about the same I I would say that culture of that team is is really good I think that's one thing that stands out cuz cuz CAC is half of Capitol Hill right you're getting more LTV and lower CAC can't right is it that the people that are coming cuz it's insurance so is it that they're like filling better like what like how how could they get LTV to be so much higher do you have any other data that's you collected together yeah so this are from Google AdWords well these obviously do significantly better than your Facebook ads yeah for sure interesting so right off the bat look all the way to the right row ad means return on ad spend so you see 12 to1 24 to1 9:1 I'm seeing really strong roow eyes here and so I'm thinking okay so if I have a machine that I can put a dollar in and get $24 back out I want to put as much money in that machine as seemly possible and so that's why my next question I'm asking how much more can can we spend here this is obviously a profitable channel are you maxed out on spend here uh I don't think I am the I work with a a third party company on this and and I basically go off their recommendations okay I personally would love to spend more obviously on this because the return so high yeah um and these people are in you know immediate need of help yeah so they're much easier the or case acceptance goes up much higher with these patients High intent yeah really good well I mean shoot this is this is the most promising part so if you think about people's willingness to pay being proportion to their spending power and the pain that they're experiencing with it now he literally has people in pain and so when you have someone who's being Interruption based I means like they're just scrolling around and they see an ad they're probably not as in pain as somebody who's like ow I just did something to my back they're on Google they're searching for a solution immediately so the intenses are completely different or rather they're significantly stronger with people that are actually looking for the solution and so I would wager that those people buy faster they buy bigger tickets and we'll see if that's true walk walk me through the sales process so day one patient comes in we do a consultation we take X-rays we'll do an exam and actually start me from click to close so the person clicks on is Google is basically the sales process for Google ads different than sales process for meta or how's it how's it flow for you yeah so Google they will call directly into our we have a centralized uh call center that we have so they'll call in Click to call is the app click to call or click to schedule on our they go to our landing page okay so click a call or or or they self book got it so then they they talk to a rep that's centralized that rep does some sort of Discovery call do they look at their insurance at that point on the call they don't but that's the thing I'm thinking of adding in so we can get on top of that so they they do some sort of Discovery they're currently not doing insurance on the call yep all right so then they do what so then they schedule them uh the the next available time we try to get them in same day or next day right away so some people call and then they book them and the people who self schedu just book directly exactly and then what's the what's the kind of like reminder sequence there to make sure that cuz you have really good shop rates yeah so we do uh three text messages and then we do a pH call uh if if we uh if they don't respond to text message do a phone call the night before to confirm we'll do another one like uh you know 2 hours before their appointment So Raven is describing what appears to be very boring work but is one of the biggest levers that I look at that is often huge holes of revenue for most small businesses that they simply just don't work their leads either well enough fast enough or hard enough they're not responding to them quickly they're not personalizing the reach outs they're not doing it multiple times and they're not doing it in a timely fashion relative to when they're coming in and so he clearly had a system for for work leads like we text him these three times this and we do this and so as soon as someone demonstrates that I'm like okay there's probably not immediate holes in Ling fruit there and his numbers kind of supported that said differently when you see 80% show rates you've got somebody who knows how to work leads okay so three reminders and call if they have not confirmed their and followup call as well if they didn't pick up the first call or the other ones and then if someone doesn't hit any of those five do you pull them off the calendar we don't pull them off the calendar but we we kind of expect them not to just like double book kind of yeah exactly okay yep okay so then they come in so they show up to the appointment now what they come in for their appointment uh we'll we'll do a consultation so we have a patient coordinator that does it that gets the preliminary data it's like an assessment yep ex like movement like move here does that hurt that kind of thing like Z where you have pain kind of like half closer framework okay so like so they'll do the first half of that on there and then uh then we'll take uh x-rays we'll do an exam and then we'll tell the patient that hey we need to process these films or these X-rays and then can we need to get you back in tomorrow so we can go over the results of the X-ray yeah that's where Ling people yeah that'ss okay so then we'll release them for we we'll still do treatment that day we'll do a light treatment and then we'll have them come back the next day and by then by then we'll have everything verified and then we'll have a customized plan for them and then we'll present the fin can you walk me through the ad funnel with the uh Facebook ads we have a video ad out there do you have ads live right now yeah can you um pull up Facebook ads Library we're going to pull them up and we're going to we're going to see it we're going to see we're going to see for ourselves all right so we have different creative it looks like it's the same copy all right so I think there's probably just some work that could just happen on the actual ads themselves like I think you could have a clear call out and the first line I would probably separate the call outs so it's like atten ever in surrounding areas so inste areas I would go to like residents or something like or people basically combine the two where as chronic back pain doesn't have to be life sentence attention efforts for your uh so be like attention ort like residents with back pain that combines both lines punch you put two Asters on either side it's like okay that's what it is and you're putting proof first and I probably wouldn't he I'd probably lead with a question which would be like are you so either I would lead with a question that' be some sort of like more specific pain or I would lead with the offer and then have the proof of why they should believe that I can help them after they've seen the offer cuz like it took us all the way down to actually see what the offer was got it in the headline if you scroll all the way down Michael avoid surgery try spinal and decompression I would probably just put like the offer there so it's just like a restatement like free spinal uh decompression but $99 value whatever something like like that's what I would what I would put there there's a lot of words and I think you could probably get just like I combined the first the headline and the excent into just like attention Everett residence with back pain right it's like boom we got that and then it's like you'd be amazed at how much like just changing tweaking the headline probably compressing the copy into a handful of bullets it's like do you struggle with boom boom boom boom and you probably tried boom boom boom boom but there's a better way this is how we do it we've helped this many people for limited time we're doing X Z and I think I think that would probably work well I cannot guarantee availability we commodate 10 vouchers ofation schedule I do like that could probably be compressed okay like we can only we can only see 10 new patients per week right scheduling availability is first come first serve for this treatment done so I'm walking Raymond through some improvements to his ads and I wrote a book on advertising and in the PID ad section the first part of a re ad is a call out right is getting people to notice the most important the ad right that's that's what this is and so the call out is whatever you do to get the attention of your audience and so there's kind of four ways that I like to do it and the way that I'm presenting for him here is a yes question right which is like it's almost implied so we're saying this audience of people which is local area and then the like do you have back pain or who have back pain is kind of an implied yes and then we're leading with that for the call out which is the most important part of every ad it's the only thing most people are going to read so once you have to call out I use a what who win framework when I'm thinking through ad copy and so he's talking about like avoid surgery so this is opposite nightmare scenario right and so you can basically construct your ads by put piecing these Parts together in the ad copy and then obviously we want to have the offer very clear when we get to the offer section that's where we need to tell them what to do next which is kind of the last part of the app one of the reasons I love doing these is that I get to take some of the experience that I've had from years of work and actually just help other people out and so one I had a chain of six locations so I had to work leads and get people to show up all the time and write ads to get people to do that and then secondarily we had a licensing business that licensed to thousands of brick and mortar locations and so I had to solve these problems at scale across many different markets and so the nice thing is the patterns are the same and you just have to execute them and so I'm glad that I could CH let's go to schedule appointment uh Kent okay so we just go straight to it straight to the booking okay I would see most of our patient schedule like that versus call there's a couple of things that I think we can go over in terms of sales process lead magnets things like that honestly I think a big part of it that's not up here is the Ops in this type of business it's so operation heavy in terms of like kind operational excellence I had a hunch that if he has the same model at all these locations and some of the locations aren't profitable and some of them are the biggest lever is going to be the people who are actually running the system so I have to be really particular about what recommendations I'm going to make if there's very weak Ops and execution behind it and so one it's going to limit the things that I'm going to do and change the priorities of what I'm going to recommend and so a lot of times business owners are like oh I need to change my strategy when the reality is that like the team's just not good enough and need to focus on the team rather than the model you absolutely can run a 10 to1 15 to1 you know uh row well you're already doing on Google but you can do that on Facebook as well um if the offer is right and so right now the offer is like there really isn't one let's just like try this thing um it doesn't even say free once you come over here and then we'll we'll walk through game plan cool cool yep all right let's on there's inconsistent lead flow there's the sales process that I want to look at I think the discovery process need something need a better front-end offer increase ey spend so those are those are the really tactical things that I'll walk through I think that we're going to look at me magnet I think this needs to be better for ads let offer is number one uh number two is yeah copy number three I think we're going to go I think the um Disco process disco dancing the discovery all right number four [Music] process do you have financing oh no you don't have financing because you're Insurance uh we do we do so the decompression is cash so we do offer financing okay do you you have a third party y okay cool then I I W so Raymond has obviously he's got a successful business he's doing 5 million Top Line 1.3 bottom line so he's not he's not doing he's not doing bad and so a lot of my questions were probing questions to see if there was lwh hanging fruit that already exist in the business that we could kind of tweak and immediately increase the profit and revenue of the business and so these are the kind of holes that from asking the questions like oh we can improve something here we can improve something there sometimes I asked and you I was like no that's good you got it all right and move on to the next thing and so to be clear it's not like I'm trying to say like he has all these things wrong he's making money's he's making more than a million dollars a year like he's obviously good at business and so I'm just trying to find the things that I think I can add value that are ideally low operational risk for him to execute Raymond's actually on level six which is all the way over there my arm's not that long of the scaling road map he's at 20 to 49 employees right between all of his locations and to get to 50 he has to do some of these steps now if we're looking at the constraints of his business we can see here that he's having this sales issue so what sales issues occur at level six well closing efficiency on core product drops becomes inconsistent refunds go down but so do closes and so he's in this situation right now just right out of the book I'm telling you like we spent a long time on this and businesses behave in patterns and so to graduate he has to install Better sales training individual coaching and a team Cadence for making sure that they operating at kpi or above so key performance indicator kpi and so this is what he has to do at this level and if you're a business owner and you are curious what stage you're at and what things are kind of plaguing you well you probably know your problems but how to graduate to the next level and how to solve them this scaling road map is totally free and it's personalized to you so you can go to acquisition. comom roadmap just type in your business info and we will send you the road the the stage that is specific to you across all eight functions of the business so product marketing sales customer service it recruiting HR and finance you'll have all the problems and the solutions to get the next level it's one of the most valuable things I can give you it's absolutely free go check it out and if you by the way want to have us take a look at your business uh on the thank you page you can book a call you can come out to our headquarters and our team would uh love to kind of do what we do here uh with you okay so we're going to start let's actually you know that's actually not a bad not not a bad order okay so um starting with the lead magga I think that offering $19 $29 somewhere in there first consult or free x-ray or something to that extent would probably go way better um and I do like especially for your your type of business to do a low ticket and so it's something like this so be like $29 uh x-ray you know plus you know assessment blah blah blah and the reason I like this is because you get the credit card on the phone okay and even though it's an insurance thing it's like Y no worries we just put a card down just for for show rate obviously we have a doctor who's going to be there we to make sure that you're going to show right and the thing is that if we build them the 29 then the likelihood show up is super high and this is literally just to take show up rates to like basically 100% so then and this is over the phone so this you do that's a phone I did this in front of some gen Z kids and they're like What's that like Jesus all right you'll recognize it so we do this now when they walk in the door okay so this is going to be a little bit of a departure okay yeah so they walk in the door and when you um and I think the reason that you probably sold better obviously you're better at sales than probably your your docs are but if you think about how sales works so sales you want to sell at the point of greatest pain not the point of greatest satisfaction so let's say to be a normal person they're right at the middle of this line right now they're they're having a bad day because now they're in pain right then all of a sudden they get something fixed now they're even better than normal if you're a Salesman where do you sell do you sell when they're here when they're in pain or do you sell here when they're super happy at the point of greatest satisfaction so do you sell it point of greatest deprivation or point of greatest satisfaction AKA pain or value where do you sell here so if I let's say you walk into my restaurant all right and you're starving and I say hey here's a steak and you eat the steak and then after you eat the steak I say hey how was the steak you say oh my God was the best steak of my life amazing and I say great would you like another steak you might be like I mean no but I mean hey the steak was great great like I'm I'm not saying the steak was bad I'm like why don't you want to buy another steak you said it was so good why don't you want to buy another steak does this sound familiar cuz I hear some sales calls from businesses like well if it was good then why aren't you buying more because you're selling at the wrong time now let's play the let's play the play the tape back you walk to the restaurant you're starving I say hey how hungry are you you say I'm starving and I say cool you want two staks you probably be like hell yeah I want two staks I'm starving and then I sell you two stakes you sell at the point in greatest pain not the point of greatest satisfaction now here's where it gets tricky sometimes the point of greatest satisfaction for one thing becomes the point of greatest pain for another so if all of a sudden I help you make more money for example then all of a sudden you have a new problem which is you have taxes and then I say hey with all that extra money that you made I can introduce you to somebody who can help you with your taxes do you want that yes and so where people canate this in terms of ORD is you have to make sure that if you're doing an upsell at the point of greatest satisfaction it's opening the loop of pain for the next problem that you're going to solve through your next product and so it's kind of the same thing here where people are literally coming in pain ideally what I would want to do is we take the assessment instead of doing the treatment then I want to sell the package got it then if you want if they have time they can do it or they can come back tomorrow and get their first treatment got it so it's the same time scale we just move the order around because like I mean I I've been this patient so like I go go to the caropractor they do some thing I'm in pain they adjust my back and then they're like hey uh come back for this but I was like I know I'm good like you you fixed it I'm great totally right and then they're like but it's not a long-term solution and I'm like good enough for me you know like I I'm out and so that might be an immediate like 15 you know 10 to 15% boost in sales so like that's number one but the thing is is that I think that your close rates are going to go up so one is like you're losing some on the drop off right but I think close rates will go up and like when you're in pain your desire for a more like all the desire is there in that moment and we're emotions there we're missing it hey guys this channel I make for you business owners this is all I do every day this is what I love I'm so excited about this new series and so if you have other business owner friends that could benefit from some of the tactics because these tactics work across lots of different Industries not just chiropractors right it would mean the world to me if you just put into a text and you text it to them or you share it to them in a DM CU It ultimately helps more businesses get better and I believe in private Enterprise and I think that's how the world gets saved no one else is coming for us all right back to the video I always had this rule at least like with Fitness is like when someone walks in the door first thing I want them to do is expand the gap of where they are where they want to be so I'd have everybody hop on the scale the amount of people like oh I don't want to hop on this like I know I'm like get on the scale we got to know where it's just a number we got to know where we're at Mak sense and so it's the same idea with this got it okay so uh lead mag in terms of off- ride do you think this would be good this will increase show up rates overall getting somebody to get a $29 credit card purchased with fund is like not hard um they do that that secures their spot then when they come in we do um same day sale mhm now what has been the issue with the docs making this sale like you said they struggled with this so there's two elements you said there was insur like some insurance stuff there so what what's the issue here yeah so the issue is uh patient comes in and then uh we have to verify their benefits so there's there's like 20 different insurances and and every patient has a different like coverage or whatever right yeah so then we got to we have to we have to make our uh treatment plan then take out whatever the insurance covers and then they pay the their co-pay Co TRS so just doing that process um I think when they're on the floor seeing patience and then having to switch gears and uh do the math of like what this you know here's my recommendations here's you know all that I think that part kind of stresses them out how much of it is templated lot most of it like as far as the so we have we know that someone has Blue crossby Shield so whatever yeah yeah it's all exhaust BR you we can punch in number we have financial calculator for that so question so someone call so basically there's two spots that we can put this this process so either we can do it on the phone right with the go yeah or we can do it the moment they walk in the door so it would work like this so someone walks in and say hey do you have your ID on you I just want to confirm your appointment yes I'm Sarah cool great do you have your insurance card on you yeah and so you asked that but that way we can get the templates already like ready to go so that then the doc goes and then he leaves them in there and says cool let me get the x-rays and then he comes in with the x-rays and with a template for their specific insurance totally and then you can just match them and just do the sale yeah so the issue is like some of those some of those so I centralized where they verify those benefits right um some of them could take like 30 minutes to an hour to so if that's that's the okay so then we have to do it with the phone yeah I agree so what we're trying to do here is we're trying to decrease the friction associated with them giving us money and so there are three major levers to providing value the the fourth is obviously the dream outcome that they want to they have to want what you're what you're selling right but the other three correspond to the risk aka the perceived likely of achievement how long they have to wait and what they got to do that they don't want to do or they got to stop doing that they do want to do AKA ease or difficulty so you want it to be easy you want it to be fast you want it to be risk-free what we're doing here is saying okay well he had this big delay in the process that people had to wait another day in order to get the solution presented to them and so wouldn't it be better if we could just have that happen prior to them coming in so that from a speed perspective and a friction perspective they don't have to do anything besides say yes and then we can get we can get paid and they can get helped and for those who are curious that was the value equation chapter in the $100 million offers book The $29 gets in the way then we can still just do the it's like a you can either do a free offer like free x-ray free assessment whatever just if that's an issue I mean personal preference get the credit card and the insurance card yeah over the phone if it seems like a training issue then I would prioritize the insurance card but then that way it's like you already have everything they're pre-loaded and so then they can come out after the x-rays get it printed out from the scheduler the front desk and I mean shoot the morning of add theop print all the print all the the packets out for everyone and then the doc gets them in the clipboard when they walk in the door perfect yeah I mean you think that would work I I think so okay um and then if they ask like hey why do you need my insurance I thought it's $9 bucks then we'll say like hey just in case the doctor thinks he can help you that's want to know while your insurance yeah better I'll give you a different one this is just how we always did it okay so the reason I gave Raymond that line is because it only always works and I'll tell you the story behind this so I used to try and sell free trials and believe it or not there was a time in my life where I couldn't even get people start free trials with me they literally get in their car drive to my gym and i' be like hey you want to 14-day free trial and they would say yeah and I think cool do you want to put you know your credit card down and they'd be like why do you need a credit card if it's a free trial I'd be like I uh I mean it well I know I didn't know it like cuz I want to bill you later like you know like I didn't have anything to say and so one time it just came out and I was like well this is just how we've always done it and and after I started saying that no one objected and so despite how ridiculous that may sound it's unbelievable how well it works so if you're in one of the situations where you have like a tiny little process change or something that you need to do or introduce you know into a sales process like why are you collecting my information now it's like oh that's just how we've always done it and people just know that a lot of employes just do what they're told or they just do whatever someone you know taught them to do it's policy and so then what they do is they just stop asking that person questions cuz they're like it's not really up to me it's it's just like oh this is how we compete our our patient profiles okay perfect like it's better to appeal to policy totally they'll get this if this for whatever reason ISS you you'll you'll prioritize the insurance they'll come in they're going to have the printed out stack yeah of all the insurance the doc gets this on a clipboard yep right in order of the patients that he sees that day um he's like okay Mrs Johnson I've got your X-ray here I've got your insurance here okay this is what we're going to do for you and then this prescriptive close makes sense okay so right now are there some locations that are having like way higher close rates than others or like what's the highest close rate probably I would say Capitol Hill and uh what's the difference though the docker has a lot of certainty no no no uh percentage difference oh um so let's say Auburn is let's say they're averaging about 55 60% okay and then uh Capital Hill might be at like 80% okay no I mean they're both okay you terrible yeah they're not terrible but if you look at um cuz cuz a lot of these people have insurance so their entry level uh like Financial is not like super high on so so the ones that are just 10,000 case they have zero out of pocket yeah so I mean you got you're going to have 100% so kind of so this is how I would so I would imagine that the packages themselves are going to be similar it's just how much is being covered is going to be the difference right yeah and then also the fact that I think if if a clinic sees a lot of those 100% coverage ones then they kind of skip then they start they don't work on their sales skills for the ones that are and then they can say oh these are crappy leads or shitty leads or whatever yeah but just cuz you have to work a little bit for them right so I think just creating that training that's that's how I'm you to train them and role play more I'll give you something that will help you a lot with brick and mortar so I've done a lot of brick and mortar sales processes in my life and um as much as possible I like them to be like clicks and check boxes when we sell something for example it's like you literally just turn a laptop around and then you just like punch through it and you literally just say the words and then at the point that you ask for the thing you ask for the like you really can machine it that way yeah and that will eliminate so much of the variability between people and so I would look at what the top 80% guy is doing consistently make that into the basically the deck so that they have a visual aid to go through it and then it just feels like oh this is this is the next step I do this this is what you need this is what we cover he circles the thing on their on their thing turns it to them and then they they they rock and roll and then they just book out their next appointments I'm assuming so they're kind of looking at a tele proper almost like okay but they can show it to them okay so there's two ways to do it one is you have the laptop and you turn it towards the customer and then you basically read the words on the slides that is like the perfect sales pitch but with visual aids and whatnot got it the second way of doing it is you have that clipboard M but they don't know what's on the clipboard right and so the clipboard just has the script got it and so it's like cool I'm just ask a couple questions and so you basically go through the sales process and you just look like you're checking off the boxes as you're going through a script but then they always say the script and then the doc can visually showare this which they then staple to the the patient contract that way you know they follow the process and then it just keeps it consistent every time so either of those work I've done them both okay so leads page 207 if you have employees and you want them to do what you want them to do then there's three steps document you make a checklist demonstrate you do it in front of them duplicate they do it in front of you and so right now the who's actually doing it is that he wasn't the the salesperson he did say he is good at sales though and say okay I need you to document this by putting this into a checklist give it to someone else for them to follow it so now that you have it in a checklist now you follow it in front of them so they can you prove that the checklist works that and if you keep changing things while you're not using the checklist then keep changing the checklist until you actually follow it and then once you have the checklist right have them followed in front of you and then once that happens then you've been able to duplicate the skill into somebody else and that's going to be a huge issue or rather a huge opportunity for Raymond and his business so the next one is I think ad spend needs to go up so what cuz you're not spending very much yeah I know you know it wasn't until I had to do this process I was like we can because the return is so high on some of those things and if I I mean I would spend like a million dollars a month on Google AdWords if I could yeah yeah so how do we like I guess that would be one thing to increase well the first thing I would do is just literally tell them like I need you to double the ad spend and I need you to find more keywords so just find more for me got it the other thing that might be worth looking into um would be uh local SEO okay because SEO especially for intent based so it's like obviously there search but it's not hard to win at SEO locally like nationally you want to win back pain it's good luck but like you want to win Everett you know chiropractor Everett spine Everett pelvic Health Everett low back ever lumbar ever like you mean there's so many sciatic like all those I think you could probably win on longtail keywords so I'll put that as number seven um so right now Raymond is is doing the core for so this is page 49 of the leads book all right so this is about advertising getting leads and so he is currently running payad so one of the core four but I think that he has an opportunity on posting free content on his site to drive SEO if you don't know SEO is it's search engine optimization so that people who have high intent who are looking for a chiropractor in my area or other keyword or longtail terms will get sent to that site to maybe read a blog arle or something that sounds interesting and then while they're on the site they can take one of the call to actions in order to kind of take next steps in the funnel and then one thing that helps us on that I think is we're pretty good about getting reviews we have more reviews than everybody in our cities oh that's great and then I think that helps with the local SEO um but yeah and the the I guess the big question is like with the ad Spin A lot of these so the agencies that we hire like they work with uh many chiropractors right so those most chiropractors don't do what we do which is sell packages of 2400 they do visit to visit which is which is a nightmare um so I think that they base our ads Ben they're recommending our ads Ben based on that but my return on is so much higher than the average guy oh yeah so then out spend everybody totally so if you might have to talk in um in marketer speak for them okay and just give them this a Target CPA like cost to acquire or CPL and just say like listen I can I can pay up to this so like Make It Rain dude if as long as it's under this I'm good if you're managing an agency the more specific you can be the better and so you have to kind of learn some marketing language so that you can talk to them like marketers and I also tell you they'll respect you way more if you can speak their language what you're going to be looking at is either CAC depending on you know what IND it's either CPA or CAC typically CPA means cost per acquisition CAC is cost you acquire a customer both terms fundamentally mean the same thing and or uh CPL so cost per lead I like to kind of break this down into two numbers one number is what I will tell them is my acceptable range and then the number that's actually my acceptable amount because sometimes they tend to overshoot this is just me with a history of agencies and so I'll give I'll build in a little bit of padding between what I tell them and what I'm actually willing to pay but the more you trust the agency the more those two numbers can be closer together because if you build trust build a good relationship the higher up that number is the more traffic they can ultimately send you because they can spend more to get you a customer and would you have when would you consider bringing that all in house um cuz I kind of I hate dealing with these no I get it I get it it probably wouldn't be my priority right now cuz like if I look at this I'm like okay we got 12 to1 24 to1 91 so I'm like we're doing pretty well on this right um and do you not have do you have Google on the other three as well yeah okay it's just not there I picked a one like a high middle low for so that's low 9 to1 is a low one yeah for sure oh that's great jeez okay cool I would say basically I I'd stop it at 5 to one okay and say like so basically double or triple whatever the CPA there currently is and sometimes what you'll find though is that if you can double or even triple how much you can spend to get a customer you might be able to like 10x lead flow it's not like it's not it's not it's not proportional uh because you just all of a sudden you outs spend this many more people to to illustrate that what what I'm explaining to Raymond I'm going to give you two hypothetical examples all right so let's say I say you you could spend $11,000 in scenario one and that'll turn into $10,000 now you might think wow I should do that but wait there's more what if I said you could spend $10,000 and make $50,000 which one would you rather have well hopefully hopefully this one because here you make $40,000 net and here you make $9,000 despite the fact that this is a 10:1 versus here you have a 5 to1 so you have half the efficiency but you have four and change times the amount of absolute return and I see many small business owners get stuck in this trap of being like I have to optimize this I have to optimize this and you do to a degree but at some point sometimes you just got to spend more you need to expect efficiency to drop at scale it's just part of the game cool so local SEO add that in all right so let me do this so what I want to do is I want to reorder these okay um so that you have kind of like next steps does that work yeah okay sweet I feel like we can I feel like we're making profit I I like that pres I like the doing it before this makes total SI dude it's it's all it makes all the change in the world so what I'm about to outline is the next six months of work for Raymond and I would say a relative amount of increase that these tactics can do for his business and so one of the key parts of laying out a plan like this is making sure that the person has the right resources and that they're doing them the right priorization order right if there's something that takes 5 minutes and can double the business well let's do that first and I tend to say the heavier things for later unless it it absolutely has to be done first and the other ones are contingent on the execution of that and so by and large I will do light work high impact first and then often times there's the heavy work heavy impact that has other things that tail or are attached to it as the order of operations for him now we started this whole conversation around operations to make sure that they had the right people in the right seats to actually execute these strategies and so that's also something I'm taking into consideration when I'm laying out this plan so I'm going to use black here so we're going to go um in order so number one oh you're good as increase Google spend so that's number one and you're going to try and spend as much as you possibly can Facebook wead magnet $29 offer three tighter ad copy what I would do honestly is I would look at so this is how I would how it how i' spy on some so I would look for chiropractor agencies that specialize in higher ticket and then I would look at their customers okay and then I would look at their ad accounts and then I'll bet you that they run the same ad copy that seems to work really well for all of them right and that's where I would look at for if I was like if I had to do my 1.0 version okay so number four um this is going to be the credit card plush insurance card uh setter this is cool number F there we go number five print out morning of insurance plans six um we need the sales manager to take over the process right manager takes sale one location test if it works well you can roll it out yeah I already do that oh perfect I got that right I would add in local SEO to get more traffic this is a long-term investment though but I think it's so worth it for what you're trying to do because the thing is SEO is going to have the highest return yeah for sure like in terms of Ro so to actually it be more profitable it's just like you got to be able to wait a year but you're looking at a multi-year timeline so I think it's just going to be worth it and that's it's not worth doing that like with all my individual locations yeah you just ranking each of the yeah each of those local markets and then like as soon as you know you're going to open up another one it's like you just yeah exactly you start spinning it out I'll just put a sub Point here same day God I love that four step sale and we'll add in sales preo SL checklist for integer so I think if we do these things we put a little estimator here I think this is probably an easy 2X in terms of lead flow and and making more money this can absolutely double the return that you're doing there this kind of these two are together so I'll just like mute there this is probably going to give us the 10% back that we're that we're losing between day one and day two right now so this is plus 10% now this one I think like the thing is with this one that I like so much is it like doubles the efficiency of each store like this one's like super super sexy because all of a sudden it might be able to take your Kent from like 1.5 to like three and like you might not have to open any more stores like if you could cuz like if you can double Revenue the fixed costs are more or less the same right and so if you doubled Revenue across all of these then you'd already be at five like you'd already be at five in terms of Eva you wouldn't even have to do anything else would that be attracted to the insal Wi oh yeah even small okay yeah got it yeah local SEO is probably like you might be able to get like a 30 to 50% boost okay it'll just take like a year but it's the nice thing is this all margin it's all margin and then the sales pres will probably be ble to smooth out your your closing percentage probably be somewhere like a 20% lift that would be kind of like my guess and so we've got a double a double 10% this could be a double depending this is more in terms of volume right volume this is uh yeah 30 to 50 and probably 20% lift here and that's probably about 6 months of work well dude that's the plan thank you so much dude 100% thank you man so I just sat down with Alex and uh he broke down my business and all the marketing experience that we have and gave me some pretty easy to implement things that we can do to grow right way so Raymond was amazing I'm so pumped to be able to work with him in this business and help him out here this was lots of fun for me probably more fun for me than it even was for him and hopefully even more fun for you and if you like this style of content really tactical business stuff you're going to love the first one of these that I did with Ashley who is a stylist and I think the tactics I laid out there could out many businesses blow up\", metadata={'source': 'sBJppqCeFGI'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"in this video i'm going to walk you through the true competitive edge that our companies have had in outperforming other companies and if you don't know who i am i'm a business investor i own acquisition.com which is a portfolio of companies that does about 85 million a year all right so my name is alex mozy we recently actually just sold a 66 stake in two of our portfolio companies at a 46.2 million dollar valuation so i don't sony any courses any masterminds and coaching cards with any mentorships i make these videos because i had a lot of pain coming up in learning these things and i hope that my pain is not in vain and uh i like it because it rhymes too what i want to show you is probably one of the most important questions that you have to answer that will ultimately inform your ability to compete within the marketplace there are kind of two schools of thought around business right you've got the kind of brain brain side there's my brain and then you've got kind of the heart side of business and the hard side is typically ignored because this one is very quantifiable and this one is not but the thing is is that i would make the argument and leyland i would both make the argument that this side even though it may sound touchy feely is actually the more important side and i'll give you a couple of examples before i give you some tactics around this so when you've seen like remember the titans or when you see a new coach come into a football team the actual strategy of the football game hasn't fundamentally changed the rules of the game are the same and typically the strategy of the team doesn't overarchingly change either they just actually do it better and so the doing it better and the higher output from each person a lot of times is not like 20 more a lot of times you can get two times four times eight times more out of the same people because they believe in what they are doing and so the thing is is that they makes that might sound like one of these motivational videos of like you have to watch remember the titans together and then everyone's kumbaya but there's actually the real conversations that have to occur in order to make the business grow and so there's there's lots of core questions that inform the the heart decisions of the company and so i want to focus today on just one of them right and so i'll give you an example of some of them so it's like why do we exist that is a very important question that you have to answer and it has to be answered well how do we behave what are our values is an example of a question that matters a lot who is in charge right during what decisions who does what those are all important questions but the one i want to focus on is the second one that i mentioned which is how do we behave the reason that this is so important is that it's one thing to know where you're going but it's another thing to know how you're going to get there and so this is just as true in business partnerships and marriage in terms of what you want uh to have happen and how you want to get there um as it is in business okay and so what i want to do is actually just walk you through the three values that we have at acquisition.com and why we believe them and so from an overarching perspective the way to come to values um is to look at what are the non-negotiables okay and so what i mean by that is and every company is different because the core thing about values is that they have to be things that are true and innate to you right like for example at southwest uh have fun is one of their core values and if someone does not want to have fun or does not believe in the processes that they do to have a good time then that is a non-negotiable for them that person cannot work at that company it is a fireable offense and so these are not aspirational these are not things that you would like to have these are things that are core to who you are as a person and as a team all right and so when you decide on these non-negotiables they are by their very nature non-negotiable which means that you hire based on these you fire based on these and these are the core spirit of the team and some of the mistakes that i see when people make values is that one they don't draw the line in the sand and so one of the core things about a value is that it has to you have to be able to say this is not this right you have to be able to say okay between justice and mercy we lean towards justice or we lean towards mercy which means you have to repel people with your values all right and so if your values do not repel people then they are not values they are platitudes okay and so it's very important the next thing is that when you're making your values the values themselves need to be ideally said in words that you would normally say so if you have little sayings inside of your community then then a lot of times those can become some of the values you have so for example jim launch one of our first portfolio companies uh speed is king do the boring work these were different ways i mean we could just say work ethic but that's not the way we would have said it we could have say be fast or fast turnaround times but speed is king was the way we would have said it okay and so some of the things that i've learned with this is also you cannot have too many values as in i'll say it differently you can't have too many values you have to be very selective at the the true core values of the company all right and so if you're you know between two a lot of times you just have to chunk up uh and kind of get a broader value but they become the core and i think that what we have found is that three is the sweet spot and that number has continued to distill down over time but i think three is the amount that your human brain can comprehend as lenses to make a decision right and the reason these values are so important is that when you scale the company you have to scale decision making which means you have to scale the frame with which you duplicate the decision making process which is should i hire this person even though alex is not involved in this do they align with the core values and the more strengthened the values the easier it is to have a black and white example of i think this person means two out of the three or one out of three but we only accept three out of three and i will tell you this as an additional point if you have core values in the business i would relay them to all aspects of your life if you would not do business with someone for a decade do not do business with them for a day it's one of the novalisms that i like a lot and so if you wouldn't if you don't want to deal with this client for a decade don't deal with them for a day if you wouldn't deal with this employee for a decade don't deal with them for a day you have to and and the extent to which you hold your line of intolerance around these truly non-negotiables will dictate the health of the organization and if you make these non-negotiables and realize that there are people in your organization in your client base that do not ascribe to these then you must make the changes to fix it and that is the pruning of the tree that will ultimately grow the tree all right these are the short-term pains for the long-term gains all right so what i want to do for the rest of this video is walk you through the three that we have that we look for the entrepreneurs of the companies uh that that own the portfolio companies that we invest in uh that we look for internally in terms of the employees that we hire and grow onto our team so this is both internal and external for us and then finally what we hold ourselves to all right and so these are the three for acquisition.com number one is unimpeachable character and as we were coming up with these over time we had like loyalty was something that was really important to us like absolute integrity was something that was really important to us like long-term minded was something that was really important to us and we were like we had all these words on the board and whatnot it was like what's the what's the what's the through line on this what's the thread that kind of weaves all these things together and for us it was we just want to deal with people who have unimpeachable character if someone has a wisp or an edge that just feels a little bit off these are things that earlier in my career i would i would rationalize and be like but they have all these other things and the the more seasoned i've gotten this the more i just don't negotiate on it it's like if i don't feel like this person is unimpeachable character i want to do business with them it's because if i wouldn't do it and a great frame of this is like would i do this with this person for a decade no then i don't want to do business with them for a day and so here's three frames that you can look at that i like a lot right and this is uh this is a little story that i got from a friend of mine who was talking to somebody who's on seal team six and they were explaining the difference between people who were seals versus people who were on steel team sex right he said listen at this level every single naval sea navy seal would lay down their life for another guy he's like that's kind of the ticket of entry to just be a seal right he's like but the people who are on team six he's like we have other things that we have to look at right you know if someone has an ego they're going to become he's like the hard problem somebody who's who has an ego but is a really high performer because they become cancers on the team right and a lot of us have these people or have had these people in our companies and i can tell you they are such a cancer like you don't know the damage they are doing to your culture which is ultimately affecting the overall company performance all right but the first the first through line here for us and the easiest one is like if we see someone who has an ego then then then we already know that they're not going to be they're not going to be receptive to feedback they're going to point fingers they're going to always think their idea is best uh and they're going to think they're better and ultimately we just don't want to do it that type of person right but here's two two questions that they asked uh in team sex that i really liked a lot he says not only can i trust this person with my life he said can i trust this person with my wife can i go and leave and leave my wife with this guy for a month and expect nothing to happen can i expect no passing comments can i expect no no moves no flirts no no no str stray looks because they have unimpeachable character the the second one was can i trust this person with my money if i were to give this person way more money than they have ever had and say i'm gonna leave i need you to hold on to this i don't know when i'm gonna be back but i will be back for it can i wait a month can i wait a year can i wait a decade and expect for that money to be sitting in the same corner that i left it and these are just questions that i ask when i'm looking at someone and thinking like does this person have unimpeachable character under what conditions do i think i could put what hot water could i put this tea bag in and see what's on the inside come out when you're asking questions and and for us when we're asking questions on interviews for uh candidates for the company but also when we're asking questions to the entrepreneurs what we're looking for is not even their answer but how they answer them to give us insight into their character and so for us unimpeachable character is the absolute foundation upon which everything we have is built the second one is sincere candor and the reason that this is so important is that we believe that you cannot make progress without feedback and if you can't give feedback then you cannot identify the deficits that exist in order to improve them and so for us having sincere candor is two aspects one of them is having the self-awareness to accurately identify situation and deliver the feedback that is good but also to be on the other side of this and have the humility to receive feedback not take it personally and to improve as a result right and so we look at this on the portfolio company side the entrepreneurs that we invest in and then also on the team side of the candidates that we choose to bring in do we think that this person can take feedback do you think this person has the intellectual wherewithal the emotional awareness to to give feedback in a way that is that is useful and constructive those are the types of things that really matter in an organization because when you have these unspoken things and these these these these wounds or these resentments what happens is this space starts to fill up between people and then their communication becomes less effective and fundamentally like running a company is based on how well you can communicate it's clarity of communication and so that is why this is so important for us as an investment company and also um in terms of the companies that we look looking to to help grow and so the third piece here is competitive greatness and i think and we borrowed this from john wooden because layla and i are both huge fans of his which is are you at your best when your best is needed the enjoyment of a hard challenge that is how he defines it but if you're thinking about this and this is how the value should stack up when you're looking at your own values which is how do we behave with this account within your company the three values should give you a vibe for the company overall like if you read these three things you should think to yourself okay people with unimpeachable character who have sincere candor and competitive greatness this should give you a vibe of the type of place that this might be if you're if i were to list off do the boring work speed is king have humility now there might be some similarities there between these ones and and uh and our gym launched one though don't sugarcoat it right which is kind of a different version of sincere kinder different flavor same concept right is that you should be able to read those values and say like i think i get the vibe for this place and you should also be able to say i don't think this person will fit in and so imagine you're interviewing someone and you're like okay i think this person can both give and receive feedback okay and they can do that effectively you know like i think they're very solid people i think they have undefeatable character when i think about the different um different things and stressors i would expose them to i think that they would hold strong but it's like oh i don't know if they're like really driving i don't know if they're ambitious i don't know if they really want to like take the hill and do big [\\xa0__\\xa0] right well then but they have two out of the three i think they could still maybe fit for the it's like no if these are non-negotiables then they are non-negotiables and you have to continue to massage these until you get exactly the true core that gives you that triangle the three lenses to look through if you have 10 values it's impossible to make a decision it's it's it's also almost impossible to think through candidates there's too many lenses and so that is why we found three to be the sweet spot for us and so and look at a different one let's say you've got somebody who's competitively great super ambitious super hard charging right can accept and give feedback but you don't think they're characters there like you think if if things got hard they would revert to something different then that's somebody that you don't want on the team because things are going to be hard in the future that's a virtual guarantee that within business things will get hard and so you're just predicting what's going to happen in the future and just avoiding the landmine and so what i've also learned is a tangible side note is that a lot of times success in business is just making fewer mistakes is trying to avoid the dumb decisions trying to avoid the people that are going to become cancers in your company more than it's making very smart moves a lot of times uh the level of activity continues to decrease as we've weathered and scaled our our portfolio but i think the the skill with which we execute the things has improved because we were just more deliberate and we try we still make plenty of mistakes but we try to make fewer of the dumb ones over time this video is for making the values within your business what are the things that you stand for what are the non-negotiables with the company what are the things that you want all of your clients to adhere to what are the things that you want all of your team to adhere to and what are the lenses that we can use to truly draw a line in the sand and say this person does not fit in and if most people don't fit to the non-negotiables that you have good most people shouldn't be in your company all right so lots of love mosey nation if you're new welcome i make these videos because i went through a lot of pain and suffering to try and figure this stuff out and i hope that that pain is not in vain lots of people are broke don't want you to be one of them enjoy the next video bye\", metadata={'source': 'kW2vDMAmlPI'})]"

       "[Document(page_content=\"welcome to the smartest decision you've ever made husters University this is the smartest thing you've ever done if you're sitting there wondering you should already know but if you're sitting there wondering is this going to be worth it or not Buckle the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up this is the smartest thing you've ever done because this is the first time besides the PHD course where I'm going to lay down all of my knowledge in the world about a particular subject PhD course was girls this is going to be about business everything I know about making money so the way this came around was I was convincing yet another person to not University I have convinced well I don't know if I've actually convinced them but I often say the biggest mistake people make in their lives is traditional education it's a waste of time it's a scam and I always tell people why it's a waste of time why it's a scam like there's the double inflation principle that I coined myself the fact that more degrees exist every year which inflates them because they're less valuable because more exist plus the price goes up every year which means it's less valuable because it's more expensive if more exist the price should go down and value are linked but there's some kind of double inflation that goes on with education which is propagated by the mainstream think tanks cuz they want to put you in there and they want to brainwash you they want to put you in there and they want to turn you into a [\\xa0__\\xa0] not actually teach you anything that's useful just turn you into a little worker drone nobody goes to University and leaves knowing how to get rich and if you look at all the richest people in the world or all the most successful people they'll say I didn't go to school or I quit University I dropped out because you're not learning anything about getting rich you're sitting there just being brainwashed it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] so when I was sitting there saying to this person don't go uni don't go uni don't go uni they said what do I do instead then I said learn from me and they said oh okay well what do I learn I you can join the War Room you can learn there so okay yeah I'll join but is there anything else I thought you know what I'm going to start my own University I'm going to give people a genuine option a genuine alternative to mainstream education I don't know about you but me personally all I ever want to do is get rich I didn't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] if I got rich breaking rocks or got rich being a professional fighter I didn't care I want money I was not passionate about some business I was passionate about money and money money only so if you've joined this course to learn how to run a business and get rich congratulations you're about to learn a whole bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] because I've run a bunch of companies you're going to find out during the length of this presentation this is No Nonsense no fluff no doubtedly the hardest hitting presentation given by a multi-millionaire on how to make money in history because all the other multi-millionaires are lying to you they're lying to you by talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] Ty Lopez if you read books you'll be rich lie you can read books all day you're not going to get rich that's a lie these other [\\xa0__\\xa0] nerds think positive you'll be rich another lie what do you mean if I read books and I think Happy Money appears in my bank no it does not this is garbage we're cutting the garbage we're getting down to it with 100 points 100 business lessons I've learned across across my business career so as I said if you've just made the decision to join the university congratulations your world view is about to change forever I don't have a seat Bel on my chair but I'm ready if you have a seat belt on your chair put it on if you don't hold on tight we're about to get rich right here husters University lesson one Le a whiteboard for you [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's how hard I've worked on this university project whiteboard markers lesson one spe now I tell this to everybody all the time and nobody understands what I'm trying to say I'm going to try and articulate it speed is extremely important in business everything that needs to be done must be done fast that doesn't mean it has to be done cheap or [\\xa0__\\xa0] it means it has to be done quickly people seem to conflate the two that if you do something quickly it must be terrible that's not the case when you're a professional fighter you learn to punch your instructor says faster faster faster you learn to punch faster you don't degrade your punch you don't start punching like an idiot you keep the same quality of punch but you do it quicker now nobody in the world the modern world especially and I'm going to say this a caveat that I've learned across my career as well especially if you're dealing with creative people in any kind of regard they don't understand speed numbers people kind of understand speed creative people don't understand speed and this is their they have a strength and a weakness there with creative people have something I don't have they're very creative and they can see see things I can't see but it takes time I'm the complete opposite I want everything done straight away now but speed is super important for a business and I'm going to tell you why so whatever you're thinking of doing whatever the business you're thinking of running you need to do things quickly if an airplane everyone knows how planes work is flying through the sky Arrow beautiful demonstration for you there a beautiful [\\xa0__\\xa0] diagram even if its engines fail it will continue to fly if the engines fail it will not fall out of the sky instantly crash to the ground it'll continue to fly do you know why because it has forward momentum it's going forward and that means the wings are creating lift air is going underneath the plane as long as the plane goes forward it will not fall and fail and a business is exactly the same the key with business is to make sure you're always moving forward always producing content and always doing everything you can as quickly as possible while maintaining the quality do not conflate quality with speed you can do the same if you have an idea right now and you have someone you're working with let's say you need a new website you tell the company it's going to take two weeks no it's not going to take two weeks it's going to take 3 days we're GNA find someone else we can't do it in three days I'll find someone who can you can build a good website in three days people have unrealistic stupid time frames everyone thinks things take forever things don't take forever things can be done quickly I know because I've done it I've pushed people or done it myself and seeing what's going be done do you know what I could do in two weeks me as a man who knows nothing about web design design in two weeks I could learn web design and build a website and I know nothing so how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] can you the guy who knows websites take two weeks to build a [\\xa0__\\xa0] website it's garbage everyone is slow and being slow is deadly to a company for two reasons one the faster you get things online the faster you start making money now if you make money today because you were in a rush let's say you quickly push and you get it online today and you make money that's one Universe And Another Universe where it takes a week and you get it online that week of making money is gone that money is lost the longer it takes to get something online the less money you're going to make as a whole if if I start a company today to the end of my life and start a company next month to the end of my life the one I start today has been running longer it's going to generate more money the quicker things are done the quicker money is made it's as simple as that that's starting a company even if a company's already online speed is super important once again I'll give you an example let's say uh I don't know know producing an advert the faster you produce an advert the faster it's out the faster you get results if you do it quick enough you might be able to produce two adverts in the time that other people take to produce one now you have double the advertising that other people have speed you have to attack and you have to move quickly when I talk to people people say to me all the time I have a business idea I'll say okay cool a week later I'll say how's your business I go what business you have an idea and it's been a week where's your [\\xa0__\\xa0] company where's your business it's been a week you ain't done [\\xa0__\\xa0] people are lazy people are slow people are complacent including you everything must happen instantly quickly fast speed attack Hitler conquered Europe with blitz cre you need to go quickly I cannot emphasize this enough lesson one speed is important nothing can be slow I'll tell you another quick story about this lesson I used to run a companies you're going to find out about a whole bunch of companies I ran and I've run in my time during this presentation so my work history is long and varied but I'll give it to you a very short version there was a job selling television advertising that required a degree a degree in marketing to sell TV advertising packages it was cold calling this is a long time ago I was 20 13 years ago before email was a thing you'd get on the phone you'd call people up marketing manager hi my name is Andrew Tate I'm calling from uh TriStar Television I'm interested in da d d interested in put your brand on TV blah blah blah old school sales which anyone if you've not done a sales job and if you are going to look for a job do a sales job because once you learn to sell you're going to be all right and you're always going to be looked after by the company because you bring the money in they're goingon to give you a nice car a nice office whatever so anyway I went to apply for this job they said I need a degree I said I don't need a degree they're like why didn't you go University I say because I ain't got four years to waste in school I'd rather get four years of experience out here working jobs I'd rather have real experience and money in my pocket and learn the hard way then go to some school and sit around and drink alcohol and do drugs like all these other University graduates are I'll work for free for one week and if you don't think I'm good don't give me the job that's what I said I worked for free for a week and they gave me the job because I'm a G so there you go that proves how pointless uni is I got the job above all the graduates because I was prepared to do one week's free work well it's bettered to do one week's free work then four years free work while paying money to go the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is that waste of time so I got this job at TriStar I'm there I break the company sales record in the first month how cuz I was just on the phone hard work just calling calling calling I would call everyone everyone in the office would laugh at me because we were a real small business we were really small in terms of Television advertising uh standards and I would call the companies like McDonald's like the huge companies that we never stood a chance of getting a deal with in a million years I'd call everyone tenacious I'd get the newspaper and go through it anyone who put an advert in that means they had an advertising budget means they had a market manager call them call them call them so I broke the company record in the first month I landed three 40 Grand deals 120 Grand I brought in 10% turnover 12 10% commission 12 grand for me I was 20 got 12 Grand I didn't have never had this kind of money in my [\\xa0__\\xa0] life I couldn't believe it turns out the top salesman there besides me because I broke the company record for the first month uh I didn't break the company record as a total but just for the first month the the best salesman there was a guy called Dan you're going to hear about Dan a lot he taught me a lot about sales and business he wanted to start his own TV company so I'd only been there a month now I'm having lunch with Dan the number two in the company and he's saying I'm going to go start my own TV company I want to make you a managing director I've been I've been doing a month I'm 20 now I'm going to be a managing director of this company but I have 12 Grand in the bank so I have a bit of money to sit on I'm like yeah [\\xa0__\\xa0] it what's the worst that can happen [\\xa0__\\xa0] it so I only work for this company a month and a half before I quit and start my own TV company I'm 20 I own 50% of a TV advertising agency turns out Dan is a massive cocaine addict and basically left me to run the entire company that's why he want me he wanted me to do everything and him just go out and take the money from the bank and do cocaine so at 20 I ran the entire company now for a year and a half this company functioned and this company functioned by selling the cheapest television advertising that ever existed so what we would do was let's say we would we would charge people 18 19,000 and that would include a fully produced advertisement from start to finish and their airtime on TV and all the legalities to get them on TV you have to go through advertising standards everything that was a complete package with like 150 adverts on TV for like 18 Grand and we were we had we're calling up calling people on the phone me and Dan eventually we hired Tristan ended up with like 10 members of Staff co- calling calling the world promising television advertising at this price now how does this all link back to lesson one speed I'll tell you how because on an 18 or 19 Grand package we were only making two grand three grand we weren't making any money on it in fact a lot of the deals we were losing money or breaking even but we were just trying to build up a customer base we were just going into meetings saying here's our clients and showing a list of clients people like how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] these young guys go all these clients they must be some kind of young marketing Geniuses that's what people thought we were but really we were just selling it too cheap so we had all these clients so how did we stay alive for a year and a half before it finally blew up in our face speed we were robbing Peter to pay Paul so we were getting money in I bought a brand new car Dan had a brand new car we had this big fancy office we're paying wages but we didn't have the money so how do you pay to put the person on TV well you get a new deal you get a new deal you get a new deal so you're paying for old deals with new money but the key was as long as we kept the speed going as long as we kept the speed as long as we kept pushing forward we were never out of business we didn't even need to make profit we just needed to get money if you can just find a way to get money into the bank you don't even need profit we were doing two deals a week in our first year we turned over nearly a million pounds I'm 20 I've got a million pound business but there was no profit it was just land a new deal so we can put the old deal on TV and eventually you get deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper into the hole so it gets to the point where you ow shitloads of money which is what happened now this business would have still lasted another two three years and this business I learned a very valuable lessoning which we're going to come to late we're going to come back back to this business so pay attention but I learned a really important lesson in this business but this business would have last another three or four years except I took a one Monon holiday to go training kickboxing in Thailand I was still training at the minute I wasn't I wasn't a world champion by then but I was still a professional fighter I was training I took a one Monon holiday during my holiday Dan just did shitloads of Coke from the company bank account just emptied the company bank account no deals were landed and it all blew up in our stupid faces law [\\xa0__\\xa0] court cases everyone taken us to court I was literally I was 20 when you're young you're scared of things there's Bay lifts at the door we've lost our office I was literally sitting there I couldn't sleep I was panicking I didn't know what to do everything [\\xa0__\\xa0] blew up in our stupid faces but if I could go back in time and I didn't take that one month holiday and I would have kept it running for another three or four years and if I knew then what I know now some of the other lessons I'm going to teach you this would have made me a millionaire at 20 years old so speed if you are moving fast you cannot fail the name of this company was T2 television T2 T2 television proves speed wins get the money in get a deal produce the advert get it out get someone else in get money now speed no we can't wait when's the meeting on next Wednesday no it's not next Wednesday it's tomorrow tell them we'll go there tomorrow they can only travel to us next Wednesday we'll go to them tomorrow we have to close the deal now money money money money money now speed I cannot emphasize this enough because it is my entire business philosophy if I had to give you one important point this is the reason this is the first point speed and every everybody is slow and if you start to work like me you'll realize everyone's slow and that's okay but things must happen quickly it's extremely important the second point of the University most of you don't know what a business is a business is money in a business is nothing else but money in it's not money out it's not your accountant it's not your logo it's not your website a business is money into a bank so a drug dealer who has money going into his pocket is more of a businessman than someone with a registered Trade logo and an accountant and all this garbage who ain't getting paid you own a business if you're getting paid that's what a business is so please understand this point because this is a very important point and this is why this is called the husters university because you need to understand how to look and Approach at a business so cash is first so let me give you an example people I say to people start a company start a m how would you start a makeup company and they go okay well I find some makeup and I'd get a logo and I would uh start a trade I'd get a trademark and then you know i' need stock listen to all the things they're mentioning find makeup we're gonna have two things we have things that cost money and things that make money as a business you're Prime primary concern is always making money and when people think of how to start a business all they start thinking about is how to spend money oh well I need to find a makeup brand I find some makeup and test it out and then get a logo and get some labels made and get a warehouse and and get a website and da da da da spend spend spend spend where's the money in where's the money this is a business where's the [\\xa0__\\xa0] money you're talking about spending money I'm talking about making money so as a hustler you always have to be about making money money in is a business not money out the amount amount of people I've spoke to said I have a business I go what have you got I've got this and I've got a registered trademark and I own this and I know you've all watched Dragons Den you think this shit's important with your registered trademark and you own this you got the logo and you got the labels and you got the product and you got blah blah blah you're not making any money no one's paying you it's not a business if no one pays you it's a business when people are paying you until then it's circle jerk [\\xa0__\\xa0] it is much better to have this right and this wrong understand me it's much better to have this right and this wrong than the other way around that is extremely important for you to understand if I had to start a makeup brand I would do none of this zero you know what I do I'd make a website with makeup on it and prices and I start advertising bang now I'm making money I'm making money I'm getting orders I don't have any makeup I don't have a warehouse I ain't got a logo I ain't got I ain't got a trademark logo I ain't got nothing but I'm making money with money you can fix the problems so when I've got money in my bank then I email everyone the product you've ordered the one you're interested in is in such high demand that we're sold out there'll be a slight delay in delivery of your product but don't worry we're going to give you one for free or we're going to give you a free gift thanks for being a valued customer customer now this person's going to wait they're like free gift okay I'll chill I'll wait now you have three or four weeks to find some [\\xa0__\\xa0] makeup to put in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] mail but at least you got money you got money in the bank you spent none of your own money or hardly any you got money coming in and now you got to find a way to fulfill the orders that goes back to business lesson number one speed now you got to quickly find some makeup find a logo stick it on put it in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] mail but doing that makes more sense than this what do you do all this [\\xa0__\\xa0] and then you try and advertise and no one buys then you've lost if we do it my way I advertise no one buys I ain't lost anything big whoop who cares no one wants my makeup oh well good thing I don't have 500 buckes of it sitting in my [\\xa0__\\xa0] bedroom like you dorks a business is money in when you want to start a business your number one concern is how do I get money in nothing else everyone who starts a business starts talking about everything else we need an office why do you need an office office no one's paid you yet and you're talking about an office I need a new laptop why no one's paid you yet you're talking about a laptop you don't need anything until people start giving you money money in is a business money out is vanity it's very easy for me to think of a business buy an office Buy laptops hire staff get an accountant sort out the tax records register the company online get business cards get a logo and get that trademark and I'm doing all this [\\xa0__\\xa0] I'm spending all this money wasting all this time and no one's paying me anything it ain't a business when you come at me with a business plan my first question is where's the money when you want to start a business the first question is where's the money how are you going to get paid is it PayPal is it stripe is it Bitcoin how are you going to get paid how can people pay you and how are you going to convince them to do that how are you going to convince them to pay you when you've worked that out you can work the rest out a business is money in nothing else that's lesson number two and that is extremely important because it's going to save you a bunch of fuckups in the future this leads on to idea number three the third lesson you're learn in business is super important I've kind of covered it when I discussed too but this is very important St ideas for free people come to me all the time Andrew I have an idea for a business maybe you need a small investment it's normal let's say you're developing an app you need to invest in the app something that's that happens but a lot of people ask for insane amounts of money 50 Grand 100 Grand 200 Grand oh to start my business you can start businesses very very cheaply if you do it the right way let's look at our beautiful demonstration our beautiful diagram here of our Makeup Company if you start a makeup company this way you need minimum 200 Grand you need an office you need logos you need trademarks you need stock you need staff you need company incorporation you need tax you need accountants you need advertising budgets you need 200 Grand 200k to start this business if you start business this way make a website put some pictures on there pretend you've got a whole bunch of stuff you ain't got and start getting money in you can start this business for five grand let's say for the website five grand that's 195 Grand difference now the problem with this business is you're going to start getting money in and you're not going to have any way to fulfill the orders but back to business lesson number one because you're a fast worker because you're industrious because you work with speed you'll find a way to fulfill the orders Hey listen worst case you give them the money back worst case you refund them but at least with this idea you can test the viability of your plan one and two you're not in the hole so let's assume both companies are bound to fail here you've lost five grand here you've lost 200 Grand why risk all that money when you can do it cheap also also with five grand startups you can now for the same price as starting one company you can now start 40 companies one of them is going to work because they're five grand each to start one of them's going to work so you have to learn that the idea of starting a business is not expensive get that out of your head I'm a millionaire a multi-millionaire and I will not spend more than five grand launching a company five grand Max I'll spend five grand and if I see money coming in maybe I'll invest some more or when the money starts coming into the Makeup Company you might reinvest all the money that's fine because that ain't your money that's money you're making you can build a company off the money you're bringing in from the company and never spend your own money that's how you launch a company now every time I say this people go to me oh well what about this what about that if you're going to launch a [\\xa0__\\xa0] airplane company and try and compete with Boeing you need money obviously but I'm talking about for you guys out there this the husters University if you're looking at making money starting a new company or you already have a small company the big some of the biggest mistakes you can make is investing lots of money when you're broke it's hard to make mistakes because you don't have any money to lose when you're rich it's easy to make mistakes because you have a lot of money to lose start companies as cheaply as possible basically for free by prioritizing money in and not prioritizing fulfillment that way you get to start companies cheap you can start a lot of them you have money coming in the door and you can reinvest money you're making in your company and build your company from the ground up every company I ever made incl including T2 television was done this way when I got my first deal for T2 television I had a Blackberry and a business card and I went to their office and I signed the deal I had a business bank account that was free no tax incorporation nothing they paid me and I used that money to buy an office done I started a television advertising agency like this I didn't get an office first office staff computers desks I I didn't have any money I had the 12 Grand from the commission but I was saving that for myself in case it all went wrong I could have blown my whole 12 Grand and set up the office but no I bought a laptop I had a laptop I bought a blackbury had a business card landed my first deal and set up my whole business off of money already coming in and if you can do that with an advertising agency you could do that with nearly anything this is television advertising this is like Premier [\\xa0__\\xa0] back in 13 14 years ago before the internet was big almost everyone wanted to be on TV that's how you start companies I started an advertising company with a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Blackberry this is how this allows you to start more businesses and allows you to see what's viable and what's going to make money and what isn't without risk it's extremely important you approach businesses this way and not businesses this way it is extremely important get this in your head these first three lessons about speed about money in being priority over everything else and about starting businesses with this Focus as opposed to the cost Focus money in as opposed to fulfillment that's that I've already taught you more than you're going to learn about business anywhere else that's key because if you do things this way it's very hard to have a Monumental [\\xa0__\\xa0] up it's very hard to lose money and also now you can start nearly any company you can start nearly any business give me a business name something completely random record label a record label you want to start record label so record label what do you have you have this is completely on the Fly record label so let me wipe my board this is completely on the Fly unprompted we're testing my business genius for the husters University Let Me Clear My Beautiful diagram here right so how does a record label make money make we have make and we have costs so record label makes money by selling records correct I've never run a record label so I be wrong so you have to sell records now a record label is a digital product so it's actually harder to make up because how can you sell records you don't have so what I'd be looking to do first thing is test my distribution channels so cost you need to find records you can instantly Supply unlike a makeup company so you need to find artists which are I wouldn't say struggling but there certainly you need to go out there and find some artists which you don't want money up front so you need to work out some kind of commission deal with artists and say look we're going to give you x amount on the base of the sales so you have to find we're going to put broke boys cuz it Doesn't you know what at this point especially with a record label although you need good quality artists to have a good reputation as a a record label if you have [\\xa0__\\xa0] ones at the beginning it doesn't really matter if you have some [\\xa0__\\xa0] ones and you sign Rihanna later on is it going to be like oh they have Rihanna now but three years ago they had that crap ban no one's heard of they they ain't gonna care it's not gonna damage your reputation so at this point you can just get broke boys Gib broke boys offer him a commission deal to make just to to try and sell records so let's say we're selling a record for a pound let's say it's a 50-50 split 5050 now you got distribution channels how you going to sell the records where you going to sell them Apple music Spotify whatever whatever whatever you have to test the distribution channels test them out test out an independent distribution channel so let's say you do all the traditional distribution traditional stuff and let's say you want to try and sell some stuff independently so let's say you start a website or you go on is MySpace still even a thing for music no what's the other one yeah so there's a few other abstract ways you can try and sell money you try and sell records let's say through their own website or through SoundCloud through some of the other ones you can try some abstract uh methods now here's what I would do I'm running a record label I find broke boys broke boys agree to go a 50-50 split I promise to sell loads of Records you have to promise this is your job so I promise to sell [\\xa0__\\xa0] 100,000 records a month some [\\xa0__\\xa0] I promise I'd lie this is what I do all the time no big deal 100,000 a month easy easy easy i' get them i' put them across all the distribution channels I'd see how much how some many we sell if we don't sell any do you know whose fault it is the broke boy's fault I'll come back to them and go okay well yeah we have two of your songs it's not enough people don't know who you are we need to produce some content so to raise your profile I don't know if you guys have any videos of you performing live we need more music we can put out there and I would just continue to extract from the broke boys more videos more songs all for free all based on a commission deal and just put it out there speed just like we said in number one like I said I've never r a record live my life to just come off the top of my head speed give me more give me more give me more the more they produce the more they give you and the more you put out there it doesn't matter if you sell a little bit of each you're going to start to make money look at what we do and what I do all my different business buiness is at this moment I run cob.com I have the War Room which is a business in itself I have the webcam business I have two YouTube channels I have casinos all I do because it's just scatter just speed scatter gun so in this kind of particular if you're going to do a record label you need to have as much as much as possible video and and music that you can that you can afford when I say afford a commission only deal just constantly constantly put out their speed on every single possible distribution Channel that's what you need to do then what you do is when you have these boys everywhere broke boys the broke boy record band you have them everywhere and you have tons of their stuff then you can approach someone who's not [\\xa0__\\xa0] or a little bit better so we have the less broke boys less broke right here my terrible writing because I'm writing on angle and when you go to less broke boys you can say well look at the broke boys we've got them on Spotify SoundCloud they're on their own website selling they're here they're on iTunes they're there look at this this is some videos of them performing yeah we use these for promotion they're on this YouTube channel they're on that YouTube YouTube channel the Les broke boys be like oh these guys they actually got them a lot of promo what did you really do all you did was extract it from these guys now the Les broke boys might want to work with you maybe you don't give them maybe it was a slightly better commission deal maybe they get 60 you get 40 take their [\\xa0__\\xa0] before you know you're GNA have a catalog of stuff so people go who's this record label you go well bang and you type any of those bans in and they flood the internet with things now you're a real record label now and now new bands up and cominging bands want to work with you just because they out have promo you got to put them everywhere one of these up and cominging bands might be the next big thing who knows all I've done in this business model I don't know anything about record labels all I've done is stick to my tenants of business one this is free this is free this is running a record label from your bedroom doing all this is some work on your computer putting them on iTunes and making a website whatever whatever that's all [\\xa0__\\xa0] free negotiate with the broke boys you can do in a Costa Coffee or a Starbucks so that this is a free business I've just given you one it's free two we've prioritized money in the first thing I wrote is how do we make the money how do we make the money we sell records okay so we need this we need this we need this priorize making the money and the third thing I did was speed quickly get out get out get out tell the broke boys to make more tell the broke boys to start a daily Vlog of them recording a daily Vlog of what it's like in the band start putting out on a YouTube channel Speed speed speed more more more give me give me content content non-stop speed all I did was stick to my three basic business principles now imagine you try this for six months and it doesn't work have you lost money no what did you lose you didn't have a big fancy office you didn't lose nothing what's the worst that can happen what's the worst that can happen nothing and that is the exact point I'm trying to teach here if you stick to these three tenants in nearly any business you'll launch it for basically nothing and nothing can go wrong nothing can go wrong point four Let Me Clear My Board might get some hot chick sit here and WR the board fact let me message a female right now sorry bear with me let me uh get a member of Staff right point four staff now this is going to be a controversial one but bear with me if you're watching so far you should have learned a lot because we're just getting [\\xa0__\\xa0] started we have a hundred business points to go through we're on number [\\xa0__\\xa0] three number four family and friends are actually the best staff you can possibly get now people say don't mix friends with business don't mix family with business can you clean my board sit here and and wipe it please don't mix friends to business get that [\\xa0__\\xa0] off don't mix friends with business don't mix family with business that's a lie so the reason people say this is because people are [\\xa0__\\xa0] and they can't get along with anyone they're not they can't get along with anybody long enough to make any money but I guarantee you have family members right this second who can make you money I guarantee you you have a 15-year-old niece nephew cousin brother whoever who knows more about computers than you do I guarantee there's a 15-year-old out there with nothing better to do who knows more about Photoshop than you do right now his stupid ass needs a job so you can start a company right now you can call up all your cousins one of my cousins works for me my brother works for me one of your cousins nieces nephews what ever some 15 16 year old who's in school and bored and say we're starting a company I'm going to make you a director you're going to have 10% of the business you're going to do everything I say and by time you're 20 you're going to be rich not bad seven out of 10 you're going to be rich and he'll come start doing work for you now if you if he won't listen to you well then I don't know if you can't tell a 15-year-old to do than you're a [\\xa0__\\xa0] but me I always have people I can call on there must be younger people don't you don't need some old old person you need young people and the reason for this is because young people have nothing to lose if you hire a 30-year-old man he has to pay his rent he hasn't got time to waste he has rent to pay he has a car payment to pay whatever a 15-year-old he has nothing he he all he does is play video games so if the business fails who cares he has nothing to lose so why don't you utilize him you must have friends or family members who are young enough in a position that they have time to waste don't hire people who can't afford to not pay their rent hire people who live for free if you have friends and they have a kid go to your friends and say your kid's 15 he's good with computers yeah I'm thinking of starting a company I'm thinking of letting him work with me for free at the beginning see if he's good and if he's good I'll start paying him they'll love that they'll love the idea of their son or or daughter getting some enterprising work yeah good idea what's the business name bang There are free effectively free workers everywhere and if they're not free they're extremely cheap and they're everywhere you just don't utilize them so now let's think of [\\xa0__\\xa0] you own a website business I don't [\\xa0__\\xa0] know website business let's say you don't know like you're me I don't know anything about building websites you want to start a website company it's it's oversaturated I wouldn't recommend it but let's say you start one you go you find a 15-year-old you tell his ass to learn how to make websites you convince him it's a good idea and then you start taking money and you give them you give it to the 15- year-old you're a middleman now 15-year-old works for free you can do websites cheap now you can do websites for 300 bucks I'll do an entire website for $300 half now half when it's done people were like $300 for a website yeah 150 bucks now done take 150 bucks give 50 bucks to the 15-year-old tell him when he's done he gets another 50 bucks 100 bucks for him 200 bucks for you you ain't done [\\xa0__\\xa0] boom wham bam done he can even start your company website for advertising at the beginning for free bang you have free workers out there find young people because young people can afford to work for [\\xa0__\\xa0] nothing you trying to find members of staff that have mortgages and [\\xa0__\\xa0] pension plans that's expensive the best staff you can find are young people and in most cases young people know more than the old people anyway especially about technology and stuff young people are fantastic I love hiring 18 19 year old kids they know [\\xa0__\\xa0] more than me about [\\xa0__\\xa0] Tik Tok Instagram all the blah blah all the [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's big they know more than me I'm 33 I'm not even old these kids are sitting there going we need to do this and this and this I'm like go then they're like how I'm like how long's it going to take they're like a week I said no it's be ready tomorrow tomorrow show me it done don't piss me off go speed back to lesson one on bang so you already have workers for your business you already have them you just don't [\\xa0__\\xa0] use them cuz you're lazy so contact them right now let's get started I apologize for the change of face but Andrew has invited me here to talk about another very important point when it comes to making money which is work with family when possible that's why I'm here now it's very easy for people like me and Andrew to tell you to work just with family members because we're two brothers and we're exceptionally close but we actually learned this from other people me and Andrew have always been best friends but we used to fight and argue when we were growing up and when we were 167 we worked in completely different let's call it Fields I mean we worked different jobs we weren't actively putting our resources together and trying to make money we had some friends who are Pakistani guys from the United Kingdom and they taught us a very important lesson one of our friends I won't say his name but he had a Ferrari and used to drive it around our hometown and we were very impressed and he said well you know how do you have this Ferrari cuz he was only a lawyer a junior lawyer making maybe £50,000 a year a good income but not a Ferrari income and he told us he said you English people you white people actually he said mixed race have it all wrong I have six brothers and what me and my brothers do is this one of us is a doctor one's a dentist one's a lawyer one's an architect we're all in different fields what we do is we live in the same house our wives live with us our wives the meals and look after our children and we pull of all of our money together that way we own the house instead of renting six other houses I that's pretty clever what about the Ferrari they said well a Ferrari finance payment is £22,000 a month more than me on my own however I don't drive the car all the time so me and all of my brothers we bought these Finance agreements for the Ferrari our Range Rover and our Rolls-Royce and we all drive them whenever we want I thought wow that is smart that's a conversation that got me and and thinking at a very young age from that point on whenever we were renting a small apartment we'd rent it together rather than pay two separate rents property prices in England were still too expensive uh for us to buy but uh when we worked together when we were looking at making money we thought how can we do this together and everything from there went into a single pot up until this day we're multi-millionaires we share bank accounts I don't know what's in whose account under what name which house which car is owned by who I mean I know on paper but it doesn't matter cuz everything is collectively owned now now it doesn't matter so much me or Andrew could go our separate ways buy our own family home and have three supercars each if we wanted to but we don't you see when we were much younger uh our first ever Supercar was an AED Martin Vantage an old one cost us £65,000 secondhand wasn't the most amazing car but we paid for it the both of us that way we had a superar for both of us to use the money we saved we put into business the other activities we were doing and that helped us Propel forward to the point we're at now so sure it would be easy to divide resources and split now but why am I going to reach the next level faster if I do that no so now I live in a seven-bedroom house my driveway is full it's got six cars on it I actually need to extend it uh now because Andrew won't stop buying cars but that's fine by me always work with family now my cousin from the United States is in a very lucky position he's now living here in Bucharest he works with us um and he essentially works with us forever as long as we're making money he's going to be here and he's part of the team when I first met him he was 5 years old I didn't see him again till he was 19 now when he was 19 he was smart he had it all going on but he was a bit privileged his mother was a very well-to-do woman a bestselling author uh on the in the field of political science in the University professor and he was at University everything was getting paid for him I thought okay you know he's not from the same world as me but then things started going wrong for him he he was uh sleeping on a floor delivering pizzas living the kind of life I remember so after two years of what I call the struggle I thought okay it's time to bring Luke back in and Luke is now a member of our team as he is a member of our family now I understand not everybody has Brothers not everybody has cousins you may be an only child you may be an orphan I don't know what you are but everyone's got those people those people that are so valuable to you that you wouldn't stab them in the back for a billion dollars and a thousand women those are the people you want to work with as long as you are sure that they share your sentiments those are the people you want to team up with pull your resources live in the same house if you're broke if you're both working dead end jobs rent one room together if need be if you're good friends if you meet a woman tell them to take a walk for an hour and come back that is the one of the keys to my land your success lesson five command respect now what I want to do in the 100 points this 100 tenants of business is I don't want to talk too much about the fluffy [\\xa0__\\xa0] that all the other millionaires talk about and teach because what they're really doing is coping out so it's very easy for Ty Lopez who has no real business skill Ty Lopez doesn't know anything about business to say you get rich by reading books because it sounds easy then everyone goes oh really okay I'll read book it sounds easy but is not true and think positive you'll get rich that's not true either but some things are true and number five this is true command respect this is true so I'll give you an example we're gonna go back to Dan the t2 guy so I still talk to Dan sometimes now and he's a good guy he's got a good heart but he just loves drugs some people do one of the reasons I'm good at business is because I command respect and I command respect because I'm a physical specimen of a man this is the reality I'm I'm a professional fighter so this helps me whether I'm running my webcam girls or whether I was pitching television advertising there's a level of respect humans have for other humans who are physical specimen Dan is a big black guy the way Dan sold and act acted and treated staff he could get away with that he couldn't get away if he was an obese white guy because there's something evolutionary about humans and if you're a person who's viewed as strong people respect you and people trust you if you want to run a business and you want people to spend money with you the one of the best things you can do is go to the gym tell you the truth get in [\\xa0__\\xa0] physical shape and people will see okay well he's obviously not afraid of hard work he's obviously disciplined there's some things that are spoken without being spoken there's a word for it that will come to me and having a physical presence is one of them it helps in business every possible way if I stand up when I used to stand up to sell TV advertising in front of people and say I guarantee you you spend 19,000 with me I guarantee you you spend 19,000 with me you get double back when they see your product on TV a product like this is going to sell do you sell online yeah where else do you sell Tesco SSB oh you're in the Superstores as well you were going to make twice your money back guaranteed if I say that as a big strong guy who they could tell obviously trained really hard was disciplined was was not afraid of hard work that was more valuable than if I was a fat piece of [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's going to work I'm like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] do you you just eat pizza you don't know anything go to the gym command a physical presence I'm not saying you have to beat anyone up I'm saying if you command a physical presence your words have more weight and it helps in business across all things everything I know webcam girls is a very unusual business and none of you have probably run webcam girls but I learned a whole bunch about business running my webcam girls in fact I approached my webcam girl business the same as I approached every other business with the same tenants I started it for cheap with a laptop I already had and a girlfriend I already had I found out how to get the money in before I found out how to produce the videos I had people sending me money for these featurelength porn videos and I couldn't even produce them I didn't even have a [\\xa0__\\xa0] camera money first all my same thing speed quickly get everything produced quick quick quick I did all the same things with all my businesses but the reason I could have so many girls listen to me is because I'm me and I'm me because I'm big and strong I'm Andrew Tate so if you want to run your business do not neglect physical presence now you can be successful without physical presence there's a whole bunch of dorks who are successful but I'm talking about what I know about business and I've learned this is the husters University and what I'm saying is it will help you even if you're Bill Gates and he was super successful and he's a dork he would have been more successful if he was a big strong dude it's never going to detriment you to be bigger and stronger in life and whether it's in business and every other aspect of life being bigger and stronger and commanding physical presence will always help you it shows discipline it shows that you understand hard work and it makes your word more valuable and sometimes in business All You've Really Got is your word you have to promise people [\\xa0__\\xa0] and they have to believe you so if you do that as a big strong dude people just believe you more this is just the harsh reality this is the hustlers University I told you it's No Nonsense there no garbage if you want to run a company start going to the gym get big get strong it's going to help you make money sooner or later I guarantee you it's going to help you make money this is0 five don't neglect it because it's very very true even if it only helps you 10% 10% is a laot 10% is the business the 10% % is the difference between success and failure 10% is the difference between a little bit of money and a lot of money 10% is is a huge difference if you're if you're selling let's say you're selling a million dollars a product and you got a 20% margin that's 200k if you had an extra 10% margin because you're the big strong guy and you got 300K bang that's an extra 100 Grand a year that's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] 911 that's a Porsche it's a big difference it's a big difference so do not neglect number five because it's real check the guns would you and here let me prove the point would you have bought this course you bought this course because I'm Andre T you trust me you've obviously looked at me and you go you know what I something about this guy he knows something I trust him would you have still bought this course if I was morbidly obese genuine question I know it's an extreme but it's a question if I was morbidly obese in my chair and very very fat I'm going to teach you about business would you have bought the course or would you have thought [\\xa0__\\xa0] you fat [\\xa0__\\xa0] you don't know nothing and if you're honest with yourself You' think yeah you're probably right I wouldn't have bought from you if you obese so that's the extremes I'm a professional fighter obese these are extremes but the extremes prove the point the closer you are to in good physical condition the more likely you are to be respected and the more likely you are to be able to say things and people believe you so get in physical shape that's point five commanding respect is always always going to be able to help you throughout life especially in business point six resell to people you've already sold to it's the easiest money you'll ever make so in T2 television when we because obviously we knew we weren't making money when [\\xa0__\\xa0] was getting hard what we do is we were selling these 181 19 Grand deals and one of the reasons we survived so long is we'd get people to sign up pay 181 19 Grand make their advert show them their advert hope they loved it and if they love their advert then we try and sell a bonus airtime package we come at them and say by the way we've got a really big purchase coming up for McDonald's some [\\xa0__\\xa0] and we're getting airtime extremely cheap and for only an extra five grand we can get you an extra hundred spots on TV some garbage some [\\xa0__\\xa0] and try and sell them this extra package and this package had some profit in it for us the spots we' give them would be in the middle of the night cheap [\\xa0__\\xa0] and this was our only chance to make any profit so if they said no to this we did all the work for effectively nothing if they said yes we'd make we'd sell it for five and it was like four grand profit that's how we were surviving so if we tried to put that in at the front end and sell 24 25 Grand packages we couldn't sell it but if we sold them at 19 and then tried to upsell them later we had about 60 70% upsell rate if people like their advert so the easiest money you'll ever make is selling to people who have already bought from you before as long as you relatively fulfilled your deal so we we did it after the advert we didn't we never tried to sell it to them before they saw the advert because then it was much harder to sell so if you do a good job or a half good job the best customers you're ever going to have have are people who have already bought from you before you should already know this about business this is a very easy one but it is so much easier to sell to someone who's already bought from you than it is to sell to someone new a lot of you watching this may have already bought something for me before congratulations you must know a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] but it's very very important it's very very true so I get a lot I know a lot of people with a lot of different businesses and they all call me up for advice and one of the first things I had a guy call me up about two months ago and he was saying he was struggling for cash he asked me to borrow money I said I won't say who he is or what his business is cuz you'll know some of you will know so to protect him I was like well okay how much you need he's like 200 Grand so how many customers do you have all in all all in all how many customers are on your database it those about 10,000 like bro there's your 200 Grand put together a [\\xa0__\\xa0] email campaign do a huge discount don't let you don't have to let it leak out into the public let them pay full price these people have bought from you before put it all together pow and blast it out there's your 200 Grand what what do you need me for if people have bought from you before and you delivered there's your money your money is sitting right there go get it so easy to sell to people who have already bought from you before if you did a half good job in in business you don't need to sell to tons of people if you can sell to the same people over and over again and it's much easier to sell to the same people over and over again than it is to keep finding new people keep that in mind especially during times where you need cash or you're trying to raise cash or you want to increase cash flow the first thing you should do if you have a company and you're making a bit of money making a little bit of money and you go you know I want to make some more what can I do don't look at advertising more don't look at getting new customers don't look at a new product launch the first thing you should do is go is there anything I've already got that I can resell to people who have already bought from me and that is the easiest money you're ever going to make don't forget that because you'll need that at certain points in your business career you're going to need to be able to pull that Ace out your sleeve and generate money from thin air keep in mind that's point six right seven this is another one that goes back to0 2 and3 but this is really important don't get legal before you get rich this is super important we're talking about hustling here I'm telling you the hacks to becoming rich do not get legal before you are rich you can fix your legal [\\xa0__\\xa0] when you've already made money it's a shame I've deleted my or erased my beautiful makeup diagram but it's very Sim similar to what we were saying earlier I know so many people who have registered a company registered for vat registered with the tax man already have an accountant and haven't made any money yet I and most of my companies will make a million dollars before I'll even consider [\\xa0__\\xa0] around with a tax form talking to an accountant or registering any [\\xa0__\\xa0] companies all that [\\xa0__\\xa0] is on the later base until you have proved the viability of your company and you have money coming in when you're rich and you have money in the bank then worry about that stuff do not waste your time energy and money doing all that legal crap before you know anything about whether your business is going to work or not don't do that it's the it's it's counterproductive and it's expensive and it's a Time sync if every time I had to start a company or an idea I had to go register a company get an accountant do tax forms do V forms what a waste of time I've started maybe a 100 companies in my life 20 of them made money you're telling me 80 times I would have had to [\\xa0__\\xa0] around don't do that I know so many people who have a company legally but don't have a company in reality because it exists as a legal entity but it does not provide cash a company provides cash if you're a street drug dealer you own a company much more than the guy with all the legal entities which ain't making money do not we're Hustlers here this the hustlers University do not confuse this money in what's the lessons I've been teaching you money in where's the money in legal [\\xa0__\\xa0] is a cost we're not interested in costs until we've seen the money in do not get legal before you get rich you do not need any legal [\\xa0__\\xa0] you need a website a domain name and you that it you do not need any legal [\\xa0__\\xa0] before you get rich don't make that [\\xa0__\\xa0] mistake the reason people do that is because it makes them feel better and makes them feel better because then they feel like they have a company so people go I want to start a company they don't know what to do and they don't know how to make money so they think well if I spend money and set it all up legally then it's then then I've got a company then they feel better inside like they've achieved something when really they've achieved nothing CU they're still not making money don't fall into these traps so you can walk around telling everyone you have a company because you spent money anyone can spend money making money is hard spending money is [\\xa0__\\xa0] easy do not do that vanity I own a company on paper garbage [\\xa0__\\xa0] all that off until money's coming in the bank do not get legal before you get rich extremely important point. n use what you got so so this comes down to one of the ideas for how what idea of a business to run so I just gave you the example of the 15-year-old cousin who can make websites now you own a website company or your 15-year-old cousin who can do I don't know [\\xa0__\\xa0] who knows what he can do he can mow Lawns every 15-year-old can mow Lawns now you have a lawn mowing business bang tell his stupid ass to go deliver some flyers drive him around your car play some two pack chill out in your car text some [\\xa0__\\xa0] drive at 5 miles hour let him drop off all the leaflets and then let him mow all the Lawns you collect all the money and just pay him a percentage bang you now own a Lawn Lawn moaning company congratulations use what you got I made a lot of money with webcam girls if you're watching this you don't know that webcam girls you can go to chatrebate tocom you see girls on there on webcam getting naked talking to dudes taking money that made me millions and millions of dollars I came up with that idea by sticking to this principle use what you've got so right now if you're sitting there make a list of everything you have and I mean everything you have a house let's say it's rented you have a car it's on lease you have uh physical strength let's say you're a strong guy when I was making my list I was writing everything down I was like well I've got six girlfriends six girlfriends so okay strip how can girls make me money strip club but that takes money to set up remember costs money in strip club I cannot I cannot get money in in a strip club without a club so I looked at all the costs for a strip club and realized it's too expensive before I could get get money in it's too big a risk remember it's too much risk I could lose three 400 Grand can't risk that how can I get money in how can I get money in for having hot girls without spending money out so my first idea was strip club but I looked at all the costs I was like okay so how why do men send why do men spend money on girls in strip club because girls are beautiful they get to look at the girls see some titties how can I do that without the club well the internet if I put them on the Internet it's cheap this is literally how I thought I stuck to my business principles okay it's cheap start looking up B discovered the webcam websites all right so I've already got the girls I've already got a laptop I've already got the internet bang the day I had the webcam idea the same day I was making money I didn't spend any money but I was making new money because I refused to allow myself to spend then I started making new money in with the webcam because I knew I had the internet I knew I had laptops I knew I had girls use what you've got look around you what people do you have does your old mother need a new job maybe she's at home and she's bored and she wants to maybe she'll mail things for you I don't [\\xa0__\\xa0] know do you have cousins nieces nephews if you have a girlfriend who has nothing to do use what you have people things you have make a [\\xa0__\\xa0] long ass list and you'll start thinking of ideas business ideas and they're going to come to you like the strip club came to me me but then you're going to sit there and go okay this is a good idea but I can't afford that but then you're going to go back to the other lessons I've taught you okay this is how much it would cost to set up that way but how can I get the money in that this would generate without all the costs and if you do that and you sit there with a piece of paper and you write everything down and you stick to the principles I've taught you so far about how to start businesses you may find a business you can start for a couple Grand you've already got your staff Couple Grand you got an idea you try it doesn't work lost a couple Grand does work bang you're rich that that simple if it starts to work speed speed speed speed more more more lesson one it's really not that complicated this is how Hustlers get rich it's really really simple so use what you got a lot of you already have things you can use you just don't use them Uber's another one man Uber is a [\\xa0__\\xa0] perfect one so I know Uber doesn't pay very much at all I know that but you know what everyone loves to do when they first get their dri driving license drive maybe you have a 17-year-old cousin or some [\\xa0__\\xa0] he's just leared to drive get his ass on Uber Rent A Car find a way to rent a car with unlimited mileage per month tell him he's going to do 10 hours of uber a day to train how to drive lie to his ass and say that you in the Uber app you can track and make sure he ain't breaking the speed limits so he drives safe put his ass on Uber pay for his gas and keep and give him half the money and keep half for yourself bang done set him up get him ready this this is [\\xa0__\\xa0] I didn't plan I'm just telling you things off the top of my head cuz this is how I think as a hustler I don't I don't need to sit and think I just know there's money and I find a way to get the money that's how I am so right now you've got cousins out there who aren't driving Uber if you can convince them to drive Uber well then why don't they do it without you easy you can talk some [\\xa0__\\xa0] make some [\\xa0__\\xa0] up hey have you got an Uber account no I'll set it all up for you because it's complicated and there's some tax I'll handle the tax don't pay no tax just blah blah blah get them in Uber get them in cars bang bang bang take the money done what are you waiting for use what you got you've already got people there's cars there's things happening you're just not doing anything look around make a full list of what you have stick to the business principles and find a way to get money in without spending money out and you won't lose that's what I did with the webcam company and it made me millions of dollars millions I ended up with huge numbers of girls all because one girl I start with one girl made money bought another laptop got another girl two girls made money bought a bigger apartment three girls four girls five girls bang bang bang bang before you know I had a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Empire of women because I stuck to my business principles I never I never spent money I didn't make first I never from my webcam company which ended up generating over $7 million I never once ever spent money that I hadn't made I didn't spend a dollar out of my pocket that I hadn't already made first from the webcam company I started that from zero just like I started my advertising agency zero and this is why when people come to me and go I want to start a business I need an investment I sit there and think you don't know about business because if you knew about business and your idea was really good you wouldn't need my money You' pull it off for zero if you're talented and your idea is good you don't need money so if you can't make it work for zero or for very little then it probably wouldn't work anyway and you just lose a whole bunch of money because if it would work if it's a good idea and it will work then money will start coming in Fast and you'll have the money you need if no one's sending you money in to give you the money you need then the idea doesn't work anyway so if I put these hose on i h I take that back it's horrible if I put these chicks on cam and no one was paying them then they weren't hot enough to be in a strip club were they luckily they were I know my girls are hot it's just an example this way I get to find out if they're good enough for free this way I get to find out if they're good enough for two 300 Grand think about it use what you've got you've already got sh out there you're just lazy point 10 staff I know a lot of people who are starting companies or they want to start business and the first thing they say is I need an assistant or I need this or I need that member of Staff staff need a clear objective so here is the very simp simple magic rule for staff staff either make you money or save you time that's a clock in case you're wondering or you don't need them so a Salesman a sales staff will sell things and bring money in you'll be able to sit there and see exactly each week how much money that member of staff made you and you'll be able to make sure that he made you more than he cost you fine other members of staff are going to save you time even if it's a general assistant or PA you'll be able to see the time saved with the tasks they've given and you need to be able to sit down with a piece of paper once a month once every couple weeks whatever and audit your staff staff member how much money did they make how much did they cost positive or negative staff member what tasks did they complete how much longer from my life would it taken me to do those tasks is it worth the money because if you could have done those tasks in your free time where you spent watching TV then you don't need that [\\xa0__\\xa0] member of Staff fire them and save the cash you have to audit your staff very specifically by this method they either save you time or they make you money or you don't need them now anyone who's worked any kind of job knows if you go into any kind of company most people are doing nothing I've worked so many jobs and everyone did nothing in fact I had a job at a company said selling advertising after I left the after T2 failed I got a job at another company selling websites and all this kind of advertising and I spent three of my five days a week reading Wikipedia because I didn't care because I had a basic and it was enough and I was and by then I was training to be a world champion and I was tired all the time so I didn't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] and no one called me up on it no one noticed three days a week I did nothing but read Wikipedia Pages because I couldn't access Facebook it was interesting that is literally the level of laziness most people experience if you take out coffee breaks cigarette breaks chitchatting in the office most people do [\\xa0__\\xa0] nothing I'm very sure you could fire 50% of the people in nearly any company and the company would be just fine if the other 50% did some real work everyone's lazy big companies are inefficient because they haven't got time to do this but you're not gonna have a big company you're a hustler you're gonna have a few members of staff you're GNA make millions of dollars and you're going to make sure they either making you money or they're saving you time now the amount of time they're saving saving you isn't enough or they're not making enough money to cover their wages they got to go there is you got to be ruthless in this game but this is how staff this is the magic formula of staff so when people say to me I want to start a company I need a assistant I say an assistant to do what oh just to help me with things what things what things will they help with how long do those things take how much time is that going to save you and why do you not have the time to do them yourself because you want to watch TV because you need to relax because you're afraid you'll burn out shut up it's garbage it's all garbage you want to feel important and tell someone what to do it's not how you get rich this is the magic staff formula do they make me money do they save me time write it all [\\xa0__\\xa0] down work it out and if it ain't good enough they got to go simple that is how you manage staff because I get asked so many questions about staff makeing money save me time done another thing that's important with staff is you have to teach staff your business ethics so whenever I have a member of Staff I've argued with staff plenty of times everything must be done quickly but that is how I work that is how I want them to work now I am 100% certain that even if it's only by 1% the fact that I am uncompromising in the fact I want things quickly things get done quickly or quicker if I didn't say anything it may take 10 seconds if I complain it may take nine seconds it may only be a tiny saving but that is how I work that is how the people I work with I want them to work work speed is everything so when you get new members of staff on board as well make sure they understand your business principles especially number one because that is your business Mantra speed so if you have a Salesman and he's selling and he's doing fantastic that's good you can sit him down and say you know what you're doing a fantastic job you're making lots of money I'm very very proud of you look you're making this this this this you've done really well that you're making Target there only one thing I want to talk about is how quickly you work like what do you mean I'm hitting Target yeah you are hitting Target but when you're inputting information to the system I think we can get that done quicker there must be a faster way we can get that done free up his time if he does things quicker he has more free time to sell more products you'll make more money speed no one ever Works fast enough when I was fighting jab cross the basics is never quick enough it has to be quicker it has to be quicker in fighting there's no such thing as too quick everything must be faster all of the time it's the same in your business all of the time faster all of it all the time if your assistant is saving you time if they work faster they save you more time because they have more time to do more things to save you time faster all the time so even if they're both performing you still have to reinen and reiterate 0.1 0.1 is super super important if you do that you're going to get more out your staff more money is going to be made more Works can get done it's better for everyone as a whole I learned this business I learned this we're going to come I'm probably some of these points will overlapped but before television I worked as official fonger when I was 15 was my first job and I used to carry boxes of ice and uh fish at 6:00 in the morning on the market [\\xa0__\\xa0] job in the middle of the winter you're carrying ice 600 in the morning it's minus five it's horrible your hands are shaking it's a horrible job and I got paid no money but I did it because I wanted money so if I'll do that at 15 your 15-year-old nephew will make a [\\xa0__\\xa0] website so I used to get up at 5: run from where I lived in Luton to the Town Center Market run cuz I didn't the [\\xa0__\\xa0] car work 10 hours and then run home that's how much energy you have when you're young that's what I did and the person I worked for was my uncle my uncle worked there his name was Keith and he always used to tell me faster faster faster faster and I was always trying to move these box of fish as quickly as possible and one when I was moving all the boxes I'd say yeah but if I finish it all what's the rush I'm here till 5 o' he goes no no no faster faster faster he'd always push me to finish it and then if I finished everything I'd have maybe three hours left if I if I walked it would take me to 10 hours if I ran like crazy it would take me seven hours so I'd have three hours spare I say now what do I do he goes there's always work to do find work to do what do you mean find work to do was find work to do find work if I see you standing around I'm gonna get angry find work that's what you used to say I'd end up sweeping the floor or wiping the walls cleaning the walls some dumb [\\xa0__\\xa0] but he was right we're going to come to this point later on if you do things quickly you have more time to find work to do and finding work to do adds up I swept the floor I wiped the walls maybe someone came in saw the nice clean pristine walls and bought some fish they wouldn't have otherwise bought if there's a tiny mark on the walls who knows the point is the work got done quicker because I was being pushed to be fast it got done and then more work happened even if it was menial work more work happened in the same time frame more work got done that made me more valuable as a staff member that's how he valued me you got to be the same right that's the first 10 lessons we have 90 more the first 10 lessons of the hustlers University I bet you're sitting there already in your minds blown they're sitting there like whoa I've learned so much I didn't think of it that way Tate you're a genius I know I know we have 90 more We've Just Begun if you've watched this video once I recommend watching it two or three times these things need to sink in like second nature to you you need to be able to recite them one by one we've talked about how you start companies what you prioritize in a company how you make sure everything's done quickly and why that's so important how you manage staff how you find ideas to relaunch companies what members of Staff you can get we've covered all this in the first 10 points this alone is enough this alone is worth the value what I've taught you and we've just begun the first 10 points to the husters university if you watch this video I recommend you watch it two or three more times before you even move on to number two if you want to move on to number two do it but you need to pay attention to these because they are the basis of of everything I'm going to teach you here on after husters University straight into it 11 Outsource cheaply if there's something you cannot do and you need someone to do it you need to Outsource cheaply you can either find a student as I've discussed earlier finding a niece nephew blah blah blah or find students students are fantastic because students need work to do for their [\\xa0__\\xa0] projects or whatever let's say you need a video find a find a film student they'll do it cheaper than uh a film company find students or use Fiverr Outsource cheaply and never the point 11 is never hire if you can avoid it please do don't hire another company to do your work so as a company let me uh remove my beautiful diagram as a hustler because I'm not trying to teach you how to be a CEO I'm teaching you how to make five or $6 million a year so you can buy supercars and enjoy your life as a Hustler you want to be here at the top that's me wait let me some muscles there we go that's me with the big arms G that's me I'm the Hustler I'm the CEO underneath me you might have to have one company let's say I develop an app I need an app development company but if I can help it I'll hire a student to make my app I ideally you want individuals below you you want this person who's your assistant this person is your sales this person does your app development or whatever and it's all people maybe you will need a company below you to do something so let's let's let's make this specific let's say I have a app company and then let's say this person is these are all people that do different things sales sales assistant sales my relationship with the people is always going to be better and cheaper than my relationship with the company because a company is not interested in making you rich and I know you think the people aren't either but bear with me a company is interested in making it self- they're very different things so if I have a let's take an example a website if I need a new website and I tell a person who works for me to make that website me and the person have a personal vested interest in such website I can discuss with him personally we can get it done if I hire a company to make my website it gets added to the list of work and then this company thinks how can we get more websites do you understand where I'm coming from the person who's tasked with the website has one job make my website the company who's tasked with the website has two jobs make the website and find more people who need websites they need to do two things and if they're smart and some of them are if they had to choose between delivering your website on time or taking on more work and taking more money they'll take the money their primary focus is not your site their primary focus is generating money do you understand these there's a huge difference this person's primary focus is completing his job for his boss this person's primary focus is not completing the job for the boss it's getting more money from somewhere else it's nothing to do with you fair enough they may have more people in different departments blah blah blah but that's still the primary goals of the individuals the primary goal of the individual and the primary goal the company plus the company's more expensive so you want to try and Outsource cheaply you want to have individuals you work with now if an individual has a company fine that's still an individual when someone goes I'm me and I have my company I see that as an individual I don't see big companies as as people I want to work with I want a website I don't want to go into some office full of people making websites I don't like that I I've never had a positive experience with that it's always expensive they always have other jobs and other things to do their primary goal is making money they don't really give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about you now if you need something very specific and personalized and you need a really big company okay do it but in most cases you don't try and work with people and try and Outsource cheaply and try and use students this is number 11 nearly anything you need done a student can do you can find students students and students are drum roll broke which means they work cheap find students if you don't know how to do something find a student who know doesn't know how to do it try and avoid going to companies companies have a different objective than keeping you happy if you have good staff under you you become like a team you become like family everyone wants to work together everyone wants everything to work if you're a good leader your staff genuinely want everything to work and you're and you genuinely want your staff to be happy it's a happy medium everyone wants success this company doesn't really give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] if your company fails if you've paid the invoice they don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] you've paid the invoice they have to deliver a website whatever they've got 10 other people they're making websites for oh your company [\\xa0__\\xa0] up big whoop work with people with vested interests students young people try and Outsource cheap try and avoid hiring another company to do anything as has a Hustler you want to have you at the top individuals you can trust below you and that is the happiest company structure you don't want to be working with lots of companies I know guys who trying to start businesses they hire a website company they hire an accountancy firm they hire this and I was like all it is is you at the top company below you company below you company below you all trying to send you invoices and suck you dry it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] don't do that you won't get rich very quickly doing that trust me Point 13 and this is [\\xa0__\\xa0] important and this is the big biggest mistake I made with T2 businesses won't last forever I know you think your business will last forever but it won't and if a business won't last forever you need to get rich quick and put yourself before your business the biggest mistake I made with T2 is I was so desperate trying to keep it afloat that I wasn't taking any of my own money I bought a new car and I gave myself a little bit of money but if I could go back in time I would have milked that cow I had money in the bank but to keep it surviving I didn't want to take so much money I had to keep Dan's Coke habit down so I reduced the amount of wages we were taking kept it low so when it all blew up I wasn't sitting on any money I kept the company alive at the expense of me if I could go back in time by the time it all blew up I'd be sitting on half a mill clean look after yourself first and this is very very important because no business lasts forever doesn't matter what the business is even my TV advertising business that worked 13 years ago would never work today calling people on the phone trying to convince them out of money when they can just get a YouTuber for 500 pounds with more viewership and they can track the clicks and directly see how much money they're getting back that you can't do with TV I could never sell TV to someone today never this is before Instagram before social media before YouTube all this came along and killed TV now now there's a few big Brands left Netflix who even watches TV that business wouldn't last anymore I bet if you told blacksmiths 200 years ago that being a blacksmith ain't going to ever work again they be like what people always need metal what are you talking about blacksmiths don't aren't around anymore every single business is going to fail sooner or later so if it's going to fail make sure you get that money before it blows up I have no problem with any one of my businesses going boom if it's already paid me if all my cam girls quit but I have free mil good if I've taken all that free mil and invested it in a big studio and reinvested all the money and made everything nice and then they all quit then what was the [\\xa0__\\xa0] point the goal of a business is to make you rich this is the point of your business to make you rich the point of a business is not to have a business for vanity the point of the business is to make you rich look after yourself first now obviously this is an equation I'm not saying only look after yourself don't look after your business I'm saying take this in mind keep it as a happy equation and make sure you're getting that money with T2 I made a mistake and I kept flooding all the money back into keeping the ship afloat it's my ship the t2 ship on the waves and I didn't take enough of the money for myself kept investing in new staff new computers dumb [\\xa0__\\xa0] I was 20 all the lessons I'm telling you now are lessons I've learned if I would have just Tak taking the money you know what get a deal in all right yeah keep it going yeah just take the money take the money take the money take the money by the time it blew up I would be sitting on 500 [\\xa0__\\xa0] Grand and I didn't you have to look after yourself a business won't last forever so you have to take the money and get rich look after yourself if you're thinking about oh maybe I need a new camera maybe I need a new car maybe I need new Vans whatever your business is doesn't matter think about it but also think long and heavy is that going to bring new money in let's look at a a video production business just come to my head you have a video production business you're filming in 4k you want this new camera it's still 4K but it does all these extra features does the lay man understand it not really if you can go to a meeting and tell them you're going to film in 4k it's the same that camera is 20 grand I don't know I don't know I'm just off talking my head I don't know anything about cameras do you spend the money on that camera or you just parket the 20 grand I'm telling you what you do you parket the 20 grand because it's not going to get you any more clients it's still 4K you can just lie in the meetings and pretend your camera can do what that camera can do you're not going to lose or make any more business get the [\\xa0__\\xa0] take the 20 grand it ain't going to add money in directly so you don't need it you need to be getting rich from your company look after yourself first because when your company [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you need to be able to say okay Abandoned Ship woo abandoned ship with [\\xa0__\\xa0] suitcases don't abandon when I abandoned T2 I had nothing and that was a mistake stake I work my ass off sleepless nights millions of dollars through the bank for nothing don't do that look after yourself first this is point 13 a business won't last forever you need to get rich quick and you need to take the money take the money for yourself don't run a business for vanity look after yourself get that money and keep it if you have to choose between you and the company most of the time you should be choosing you it's a obviously it's a balance you need to make sure your company's looked after you need to reinvest in your company blah blah of course but still you are the primary focus of your universe everything serves you including your company that's Point 13 don't make the mistake I made with T2 putting it all back in and not looking after yourself there's a reason why you can actually put this in the course look him up Sir Philip green with BHS billionaire bought BHS which is a big clothing store in England saw it was failing took billion and billions for himself let it fail let everyone's pensions go under let it sink once he realized you know what what do I do here do I do I just make millions and billions for myself or do I save this company nah for me he actually lost his lordship for it because they thought it was such an evil thing to do because like a thousand like 10,000 old ladies lost their pensions who'd worked there for like four years pretty evil but the point is the same as a billionaire he understood me first company second so he milked it there's another company it was a toy store and they ran up until Christmas day and they took all the money for Christmas no it was a catalog you remember the catalog there was these CHR no there was these Christmas catalogs I can't remember there's these Christmas cataloges and you pay every month and you build up this balance and then before Christmas you can order all your presents and all your food from the catalog and they ran up until Christmas Day and then they closed took millions and didn't deliver anything ruined everyone's Christmases I remember it was big in the news in England they ruined something like 10,000 fam's Christmases because I couldn't afford Christmas anymore but the managing director because the managing director ended up going to court but he still got away with it because it was legal he took 7 million he looked at his business and goes you know what I don't think this is sustainable anymore I'm not goingon to put any more money into this [\\xa0__\\xa0] I'm gonna take 7 million pounds I'm gonna [\\xa0__\\xa0] it off I'm gonna deal with the big PR disaster I'm G to go hiding and whatever I've got s mil he looked after himself first if he would put that seven mil back in the company would have gone bust a year and a half later and you have no money look after yourself first be ruthless with it take the money for you there's no point in go through this stress for any other reason so sir Philip green look him up he did it with BHS and you can also Google uh Christmas catalog bankruptcy and you'll see both of these people both times managing directors took their money same thing with the big Banks when the big Banks went bust all the banking directors you think they didn't take big money when the big Banks all [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you think they didn't take their big bonuses first the smart people know look after yourself first look after the business second the smart people know that because as long as you're financially okay as long as your bills are paid your mortgage is paid and you have money everything's going to be Point 12 I've said this already I'm G say it again I've been over this but I'm going to stress it like I said some of these points are going to overlap a little bit because of the way I explain things off the top of my head because I'm a [\\xa0__\\xa0] genius I don't need to sit there and script this out you can't [\\xa0__\\xa0] up if you don't spend money this is key it's very hard to [\\xa0__\\xa0] up if you don't spend money now if you have a very successful business and you're sitting on lots of money and you don't upgrade your business and then you go out of business that's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you should have spent money yes if you're a blockbuster and you are sitting waiting for people to rent videos and you didn't invest in a streaming service like Netflix and you go out of business yeah you [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you should have spent money but at the beginning of a company as a hustler if you don't spend money it's very hard to [\\xa0__\\xa0] up 99% of business fuckups are I spent cash and I can't get it back I spent cash and I lost it I spent cash and now I don't have enough cash if you don't spend it's very difficult to [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and this is why being broke is so liberating I was happier starting businesses when I was broke if you're watching this and you're broke and you're living at home with your mom you are lucky if everything goes wrong you still have somewhere to sleep you're still going to eat you haven't got worry about a mortgage pay payment you ain't going to worry about car payment if everything [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you're still okay if you're in a position where you're semis successful you have a BMW in an apartment now you can't afford to [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you're going to lose everything this is the point so if you're not successful things are even better but spending money is the easiest way to go wrong if you don't blow money it's very hard to [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and that's why we go back to the way I teach you to start businesses for nearly for free don't spend money if you're going to spend money spend on what you spend on knowledge information I'm going to save you thousands hundreds of thousands for what you got this course for but in general I see people and they're so happy to spend money don't spend your money because it's very hard to [\\xa0__\\xa0] up if you're not spending money if you've got a hustle doesn't matter what it is and it's bringing money in yeah and you're not spending money all the time you'll be okay now I'm not saying be tight I'm not saying don't invest I'm not saying be stingy I'm not saying any of that I'm saying be careful and think do I need to spend this money right now and when you going to decide if you're going to spend money or not the question is is it going to make me more money so let's take our makeup brand you have your makeup brand I chose makeup because I don't know anything about makeup because I'm a man so it's just a general thing you have your makeup brand you have your website you're doing some advertising you've got a few YouTubers makeup YouTubers using your products and you're doing some advertising you're bringing in money right you're bringing money right now you're all working from home you're from home you got boxes around your bedroom you're working on a laptop you're making money now you have some money you can spend how do you spend that money I'm asking you but I already know the answer the answer is you spend the money in a way that will bring more money in so let's say you're semis successful now you may sit and think well I want I want an office now I need to get an office no you want want an office you don't need an office you're making money without an office setting up an office is that going to bring in more orders how will you be in an how is you being in an office when the website's exactly the same going to bring in more orders it's not it's not going to change anything if you spend that money on more YouTubers talking about your products you'll bring in more money only spend money if it's going to directly if you can see the clear path to how it's going to lead to more money in or don't spend it too many people [\\xa0__\\xa0] up because they just go oh yeah let me invest in oh I need an office or we need a I have this all the time with people all the time I get approached with this all the time you need a backend [\\xa0__\\xa0] back end all the time you need to spend I get it's only two days ago 15,000 Euro he wanted to build me this super backend because I have the War Room which is all run on Telegram and all this bought so someone buys a product automatically links to their telegram ID automatically adds them in and out the War Room checks what other products they have links them into the right rooms in the War Room blah blah blah blah blah and I'm sitting there going okay I see how that would be useful a huge very complicated technical back end but I don't see how that's going to bring more people in the front I'm a millionaire he want 15 grand which is nothing I don't see how me having all this fancy [\\xa0__\\xa0] behind my website at this current stage maybe at a later date is going to make more people buy from my website so why do I need it all I need is people to buy I don't need this back end [\\xa0__\\xa0] back end this big huge backend for money that may speed up things once they've already purchased but right now I'm doing everything manually with staff and the staff are competent and it's getting done it's fine so why do I need to spend this money it goes against my business principles when someone explains to me how this back end will convince more people at the front end to buy that I'll be interested but until then if I'm going to spend 15 grand I'm going to spend it on bringing more people in the front door now if I get overloaded and there's no possible way I can deliver on my products I'll buy it back in but until that happens I am only interested in one thing money in what's the other lessons I taught you in the first two the first 10 lessons one the lessons was what what's a business a business is this this is a business this is a website ain't a business money in the bank ain't a business a back end ain't a business the only thing that's a business is this orders coming in that is a business the rest of it is [\\xa0__\\xa0] fulfillment this is your focus as long as you have this you will be okay T2 succeeded for a year and it would have been for many years because of this as long as you have this nothing will go wrong if this goes you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] you're can to have the best website the best cash reserves and the best back end in the world if no one's ordering you're going to go out business if you have lots of orders no cash reserves and no backend but people are buying and buying and buying you've got a business this is it this is your focus if you're going to spend money it has to directly lead to this don't fall for the geek [\\xa0__\\xa0] especially with the War Room I've had so many people come at me and go oh it's going to be a programming it's geek [\\xa0__\\xa0] programming and you're be able to see everything very interesting I understand why that sounds like something I need but I don't see how it's going to convince more people to join the War Room people join the war room because I'm me and I give value that's why they join the war room and manually I make sure everyone ends up where they need to be and it's fine you could argue that this might speed things up and that's going to go back to number one speed this is going to speed things up give my staff more time but I already do my staff time equation member staff time saving I'm very happy with the amount of time that's being saved the amount of money each member of staff's making me I have a good equation right now for my staff that doesn't need adjusting my staff are all fantastic everyone I work with is G so I don't need to invest a bunch of money plus is probably have a bunch of teething problems and not work properly anyway so the point is if you're going to spend Mone money be careful and if you're going to spend money you need to see a clear link to how it's going to bring more money in nothing else this is your business nothing else is your business the rest is [\\xa0__\\xa0] number 14 reputation control I get lots of questions of people and say oh what about you know my reputation people are saying bad things etc etc to control your reputation is very very simple you need to do more good than bad you're never going to have people 100% happy but as long as in general you do more good than bad you'll be okay also you'll find that people don't often really go out of their way to slander you unless you've really really pissed them off and one of the easiest ways to piss people off is to ignore them so in business no matter how bad things are going you never ignore them even if they're blowing up your email and messaging you nonstop I'm unhappy I'm unhappy unhappy try and find a solution people only get worse and they only get bitter if they're ignored because if they're email emailing you then they're not writing all over blogs and forums and making their complaints public they're complaining directly to you which means you can manage it so this is another very important thing about business everything I've taught you so far you obviously see there was some struggles along the way and I learned the most important thing you can do to manage your reputation is to take all the criticism personally so they can't spend the criticism anywhere else so someone has any kind of problem contact them say hey you got a problem let's talk about it let's see if we can work something out blah blah blah even if they're a complete unreasonable idiot if you complete if you continue to email them back and forth and let them vent a little they're very unlikely to continue to just spread crap all over the Internet because that's the world we live in now it's easy to find customers with the Internet it's easy to lose customers with the internet so for reputation control make sure you're prepared to speak to people even when they're being dicks that's point point 15 and this is very very important this is going to be a major way you should change your thinking in regards to business so you learned a lot of things so far and you're about to learn something else and I think I've mentioned this before on Twitter but if you missed it this is very very very important you have to change the way you think about money and you're going to change the way you think about money by only thinking about money all of the time so I'll give you an example 99.9% of people who go in a coffee shop go in a coffee shop and buy coffee and sit down if I go in a coffee shop I go in I look at the prices of the coffee I look at how busy the place is I buy my coffee and and I sit down and then I think if I had to run this business would I make money could is there a way I could run this business and make more money how much do I think the rent is in this establishment how much are these coffees how busy is it here do they sell cakes and sandwiches to make extra Revenue who are the main customers was mainly businessmen I can see there must be a business district across the road why are the waitresses or why are the people who work here not haot young girls to attract more men to come in if that's the main customer think outside the box and look if I were to open a coffee shop right next door could I beat them are these coffees expensive are they cheap are they good you have to start looking at every single business you interact with every single one and see how you would compete with them or if you had to run their business if you believe You' make a profit because what you'll often find is you'll see there's a lot of people making mistakes and you think you could probably do better and you might be able to beat them so you need to sit and when you're going through your normal life you're having your coffee you're sitting in [\\xa0__\\xa0] star cucks whatever obviously competing with a multinational like that is going to be very difficult but any business you interact with just start training your mind to view their business how you believe it works everything from rent overheads the product the profit margin whether you think you could sell more any tips or tricks they're missing everything from start to finish just have a look and see if you can work it out you'll be surprised how much you learn about business selft talk I do it with every bar I'm in every restaurant I'm in every coffee shop I go in everything even simple things like even things I know nothing about like a mechanics I don't know anything about fixing cars still I look at the amount of cars they have around I look at how much they charge me for my time how much the labor is how much I think they're charging the low-level workers where's the big boss how much is he making you need to start thinking about money and thinking about businesses like this every time you interact with one you need to analyze it and your analysis will get better and it'll get more precise obviously there's some information you don't know you don't know exactly what the rent is you can estimate it you should be able to estimate it so this is one of the really important mind hack I teach anyone who wants to get serious about hustling and making money you need to start approaching and looking at all businesses this way because what's going to happen is when you eventually open your own business there's going to be some lessons that you identified some mistakes you identified in the previous businesses that you're going to make sure you don't make whether you're opening a coffee shop or an online company it doesn't matter what it is you're going to identify the mistakes and you're going to change them so even next time you buy something online you buy something online most websites nowadays are extremely streamlined but still if you identify a problem with the website if you identify a problem with the email that comes afterwards if you're unhappy with a particular aspect of customer support if you don't like the packaging that comes in whatever analyze everything and remember everything because you're going to use this stuff for your new company so this is a very important mind hack this is something you need to do permanently as a matter of habit it's what rich people do when they're sitting around money being made or they're sitting around money being exchanged because money's never made money's only exchanged when they're sitting around and they see money being exchanged they work out exactly how and why and who's benefiting this is something you need to start doing as a matter of habit is extremely important right number 16 if you're work working a job you need to identify all the ways in which you could do your job better A lot of people work their jobs and they don't try very hard we've discussed this already about how lazy employees are if you're an employee right now you're probably lazy so you're working a job you're not trying your best make a list of all the ways you could improve how you do your job you could work faster you can make more phone calls you could care more XY Z you could do uh the entire nine hours without super long bathroom breaks so you disappear to sit on your phone whatever whatever make a list of all the ways you can improve the way you do your job then ask yourself why you don't do it why don't you work at 100% of your capacity and the main reason is probably going to be because you're not in centizen know about your job obviously this is the hustlers University we're going to teach you how to make money outside of your job but if you're in a job right now the fastest way you can do to get pay rise or increase your money is literally to sit there and think I need XY Z to be incentious to do this job properly I think you'll be surprised how often you can go into your managing director or your especially for smaller comp companies your boss's office and say look here's the deal I want to do XY Z XY Z XY Z I think it's going to make us a lot of money I just want to say if I'm right and it pulls off let me prove myself first let me make the money first but if the money starts rolling in that's why not going to be rewarded for it they'll say okay they'll call your a bluff because you're promis the money when you go in there and you say that all you've done is saying look I want to make you some money you say that to them let the money start coming in and they'll often reward you for it if you're not doing your job to the best of your ability then you need to be doing something else and if you're not doing the job to the best of your ability you need to be using that time to start something on the side so my work history as you can tell is very varied for a long period of time I worked when I say long about a year I worked for a company called N2 N2 sold tele uh sold web advertising it sold advertising uh websites SEO uh Google AdWords all that kind of thing so we would call up companies and convince them need a new website or did they need SEO or Google AdWords or hosting blah blah blah it a very it was like a online advertising agency this is a few years ago at the same time I was working there this is the this is the company when I read Wikipedia three three days a week at the same time I was working there I was pissed off that I wasn't a business owner anymore I kept remembering T2 and all the mistakes I made at T2 and I wanted to start a television advertising agency again but I couldn't afford to quit this job and I also knew that it was going to be very very hard to sell television advertising like I did a few years before because this was when I was selling it before was just before the big credit crunch remember that now we're in the high of the credit crunch so it's going to be very difficult to get money out of people so I decided to start a company anyway I started a television advertising company called vixel I I looked at the word pixels I changed a p to a v doesn't make any sense vixel television advertising and what I would do is my brother would pitch television from home and I would still work my normal job and in between not doing any work on my normal job I'd provide leads and fulfill leads etc etc so not only am I working a normal job I'm also having I had another company on the side at the same time and what was good about this is if I went to a company to give him a website it was a particularly big company a company I think could afford TV then I pitched them for vixel on the side or call or tell Tristan to call them and pitched them so simultaneously is doing my job I was running another company now vixel never really took off I landed three or four deals I maybe did two 300 Grand which isn't a lot of money to me now but two or 300 Grand is a lot of money to most people in a year of a company so instead of just sitting at my job doing absolutely nothing I was doing a lot of nothing I was reading Wikipedia but I was also doing as much as I could for my own company on the side so if you have a if you have a job right now don't quit your job people say to me all the time oh I need to quit my job no you don't you don't need to quit your job I guarantee there's enough time in the day for you to work your job and work your side hustle guaranteed because you're lazy and you don't do [\\xa0__\\xa0] at your job anyway you have all the time you need to continue with your job get your side hustle rolling when your R hustle is rolling and you know the money's coming in then quit you don't need to quit your job at the same time so people say it to me all the time well should I quit my job the answer is often no you don't need to quit your job until you've been through and you've sorted out all the things you've already been over so far in this University is money coming in why would you quit your job is money coming in yes or no no well then why would you quit your job I showed you already how easy it is to get money flowing in get the site online bang bang bang get the money in even if none of the Fulfillment is ready so if money's not coming in you don't need to quit your job no you need to do everything at the same time you can get money rolling in first before you consider ducking out of the job sitting around at home and being broke so that's a very important key thing about jobs I get asked that all the time next point this is very important one people I'm going to make this very very clear people do not buy on price you do not want to compete on price for whatever company you're going to run you do not want to compete on price T2 competed on price and okay it lasted a while because of speed but even nowadays that would be much harder to do and I'll tell you why the people who compete on price are going to be you so if you go to amazon.com and look at the phone cases for 89 cents for the case and delivery and it's coming all the way from [\\xa0__\\xa0] China how how do they make money on that doal I don't have a clue but they managed to pull it off there's too much Southeast Asian and Asian production now everyone's producing everything so cheap there's no way you're going to win on price you need to sell on brand here in the west living where we live that's our advantage we have the whole idea of branding and quality and reputation didn't these are the things you need to sell on you do not want to sell on price you don't want to price people out the market but when you're sitting there looking at your prices you don't want to sit there and go well you know I want to make it really affordable I really have never never experienced that so you've joined my University was I don't know if you joined at half price for $999 or you joined at the full price whatever I could have done this cheaper but why would I do it cheaper this is the value the value here is everything I'm saying this is how much it should cost so you can't just be looking to sell things as cheap as possible I see a lot of guys especially the Twitter gurus loads of them are selling eBooks for like $17 or $13 how are the [\\xa0__\\xa0] are you going to get rich off $17 ebooks you're not so if that's the only price people will buy from you at then that shows your brand has no strength no reputation because if you had genuine strength and reputation you could sell at real price so where your price point lies says a lot about who you are as a person do you want to be [\\xa0__\\xa0] Lambo all right Lambo down CU I like that word or do you want to be [\\xa0__\\xa0] this is where all the ebooks the little ebooks are this is where I am why can I sell more than them why can I sell for a much higher margin a much higher price because I have a reputation and I provide a better quality product so when you're looking for whatever you're going to do whatever you're going to launch when you start putting prices out there if you put it up high and you're not selling and you find yourself really reducing the price to try and get sales that says a lot about who your reputation is you need to do some reputation management you need to build your reputation build your credibility build on the point that you're an expert in your field and as you do that your price will increase that's the easiest way to make more money because there's only certain amount of customers in the world let's say there's only there's only a hundred incels who are going to buy a book about how to [\\xa0__\\xa0] today there's only a hundred of them that's only people on Twitter are going to buy a book about how to [\\xa0__\\xa0] today so the easiest way to make more money is to charge this hund people more money instead of trying to find more people especially with Twitter because if you're selling on Twitter Twitter following doesn't grow that fast your Twitter followers may not be that big and if it even it is let's say minor 30,000 they don't grow very quickly you get Shadow B takes a long long time so you only have certain amount potential customers so you want each one to spend as much money as possible this is the reality of the game so if you're selling [\\xa0__\\xa0] cheap like a lot of these Twitter guys do that's because they're cheap and they're lame they're lame never sell on price also you'll have more problems and more complaints from people who buy cheap things and people who buy expensive things and the reason is because the people who buy expensive things are getting Lambo quality like you're getting here all the information I'm giving you people who buy the cheap things they're just buying it because it's so cheap they don't believe in the person they're just like oh what's the worst I can do I'm only losing 13 bucks but then they'll still feel pissed off when they realize it's garbage so your number one goal your number one aim in whatever business you do is to constantly be increasing prices you need to be looking to constantly increase the price and the way you do that is by constantly building on your reputation that is how it goes even if you have to start off of at lower price you need to always increase the price you should never get to a point where you've priced yourself out people don't buy on price people buy what they want if people want something they're going to buy it there's a whole bunch of expensive [\\xa0__\\xa0] that people buy trust me because they want it so you have to make sure that people want your product do not be one of those well I'm the cheapest on the market guys because that never works well it gives you a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] customers and it stops you making Mak any kind of serious money it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] don't do it next you need to learn to shut up and listen this is a really important point for business super important because it's something I see a lot of people make mistakes with I'm gonna destroy my beautiful diagram here right most people once they start a business won't shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up about their business I know so many people who are making money and yeah they're making money but as soon as you start talking about money all they talk about is how they make money they're business how smart they are ego investment how great they are that is not going to teach you anything you only learn by listening so whenever I'm around people who are making money I don't talk about money I mean it's different if they're friends of mine I've known them for a long time we're interacting but I mean if I'm meeting people and they're businessmen and everyone's talking about how they're making money I shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and I listen because anyone who's making money one way or another knows something you don't know there's a lesson everywhere so when you interact with someone who's rich you have to say enough to convince him to talk but don't talk too much yourself the more you talk about your own business and how you do things the more time you've wasted you already know your own business you already know how you do things maybe if you're asking him directly for feedback yeah I do this what do you think of this but if you're bragging ah blah blah and I'm this and I turn over this you're just wasting time let other people talk learn from other people who are making money even if they're in an industry which is completely different to yours it doesn't make a difference shut up and listen because somebody knows something even Dan who I ran T2 with Dan was a crackhead Dan taught me shitloads about advertising and shitloads about sales he taught me loads of things this guy's got a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Coke problem that's out of his mind and he taught me things there's nobody you cannot learn from you can learn from anybody who understands anything about either sales or making money so be prepared to shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up when you interact with these people and sit and listen and adopt it be super prepared next I tell you another little thing we did at T2 actually something just came to my mind we had T2 and we had another company called angel I was such I was 20 I was a dick I don't know why I called it Angel TV so we had another company called Angel TV and what we do is we'd pitch TV companies as normal and if we ever had a company which was really close to doing it but for some reason just wouldn't go across over the Edge wouldn't buy then we'd call them up and Pitch them from Angel for a tiny bit of a discount so let's say we're pitching someone at 19 Grand we're trying to get them we're trying to get them trying to get them they won't do it then we call them up from Angel and say hi we have a onetime special offer 18,000 and try and close them that way even though there was no profit in it but the point is that's another little thing you consider another little business tip if you have a company like that if you have a partner a business partner or you have some members of staff that they perhaps wouldn't interact with if they're talking to you in the initial organization if you're really trying to get get this order and you just can't get it in you can always try and Pitch as some other company and take the business that way I know a lot of people who are doing that I won't say who in lots of different Industries who are coming along trying to close the business closing a lot but those stubborn [\\xa0__\\xa0] are coming along with another company and scooping them up keep that in mind it's something else you can write down and think about we'll come back to Angel later on in your University curriculum next attention is free advertising so you need to get good at getting some attention attention somehow I get attention because I'm the dawn but you need to find a way to get attention because all advertising is is buying attention which is fine but buying attention is more expensive than getting attention for free and when I say for free I mean free financially getting attention is still going to take time with your money but you need to find a way to get attention I think you already understand this you already understand viral marketing no such thing as bad press blah blah blah but finding a way to get attention is a fantastic way to start generating money now what most people do is you see a lot of people they find ways to get attention but they don't monetize it so for this I'm going to put in an example of my Star Wars thread I want you we're going to start putting on the screen now when you look at my Star Wars thread I said something that pissed off the Nerds you can see I pissed off the Nerds start to go viral start to get traction and for every single tweet afterwards all I'm trying to do is promote my website I'm doing it in a funny way I'm doing it in a way that annoys them I'm doing it in a way that's going to get some interaction but I'm still trying to promote my my website from start to finish that is the end goal get attention and then do not be afraid to shamelessly sell sell sell but you have to find a way to get some attention first now that's not easy in the modern world because everybody's vying for each other's attention especially on the internet everyone is competing for attention but attention is key so finding a way to do it is important I know a guy I had a guy who had a uh this is the most simple stupid example but it's true he had a it's one of these guys in Romania and they wrap cars and they're in an industrial State and he painted the entire side of his wall with a huge mural like a spray paint mural of a car being wrapped and I said to him that was badass how much did it cost he goes it cost me 3,000 but it's increase my business big time I've made all my money back big time I was like why because people look at it when they drive past and then they wanted they see it's artistic it's creative and they want to work with us he got attention he [\\xa0__\\xa0] painted his wall but anything it takes to get attention if you have a sign on your company is a sign big and bright and bold enough probably not there's no such thing as bad attention the world we live in now we live in an attention economy if you have lots of attention you can turn that into money if you have no attention you're not going to have any money we're in an attention economy you don't even need good ideas now YouTube has proved attenion economy you have [\\xa0__\\xa0] morons out there doing nothing on Vlogs talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] and being complete losers but because people watch it because they get attention they're million iones attention is the currency of the modern world so if you're going to start any kind of business one thing you need to consider is we talked earlier about money in all your money out this is your only real business the money in and how you don't want to be investing any of your money in anything that doesn't lead back to here you can see that botom one there but you know what's going to lead to this you know what's going to increase the number of sales coming in attention attention is key attention is going to accelerate everything so you need to keep that in mind don't be afraid to do things that are a little bit crazy to get people to pay attention to you now obviously I'm not saying join Isis or something stupid to get attention keep it in mind but attention is the currency attention is the magic formula that the the Catalyst that's going to take any company and blow it up fast so keep that in mind when you're looking to launch your company or you're already running your company does my company get enough attention no okay okay so which which company in my industry does get attention this one how do they get it oh well they pay for advertising or for example or they did this viral campaign or they sponsored this how is are the people taking the attention that you want how can you get the attention find a way if you have to go and run a marathon dressed as a [\\xa0__\\xa0] dinosaur with your company name on the back then go do it it's effectively free and it's good for you don't be lazy you have to do something to get some attention attention is the key that's going to be the difference between a failed business and a successful business even with the cam girls people said to me all the time cam girls that's not real business girls just get naked and they just make money no that's not true girls used to say oh what you just get naked and you get money no it's not like that all making money as a cam girl is difficult it's a real business how many girls are online right now 100,000 maybe you're trying to compete with all those titties and [\\xa0__\\xa0] it all looks the same effectively tits and [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's all the same how do you compete with that how do you get the attention of men when they have so many choices they can click scroll scroll scroll through all the titties so how do you get the attention so as a cam girl with all my cam girls I was training we would have meetings how do we get attention that's why all these girls do like cosplay and dress up as video game character instead of differentiation anything it takes to get attention so the cam industry is completely an attention industry you have to find a way to get attention you have to think about it so with the cam girls we did lots and lots of different things very small things that made a big difference remembered customers names remember the names of their pets paid attention to them said hello when they came in the room called them by their first name so they all felt valued so they kept coming back to try and build some loyal follow followers made sure that their thumbnail when they broadcasted they had a little thumbnail so their thumbnail when they broadcasted was a really hot one so it looked good so people would oh that thumbnail looks interesting and click on it make sure their room was interesting a few things in the background da D basic advertising stuff but it's all the business of getting attention don't forget that super super important right next coming on from the cam girl thing play on people's insecurities so I made lots of money with cam girls and in three days from the filming of this I'm opening my first Casino people have vices and people have insecurities and if you can find a way to twist them you're going to make money people can't help but lose Lo their money in casinos The House Always Wins people like tits and ass and they're desperate to have a hot girl that's why I talk to cam girls so even if you're running a business which is very traditional let's say you're running clothing people like to feel good-looking and attractive you have to twist that angle you have to put something on the angle so that people go you know I want to be attractive I want to be good-looking I want to look at I want to be seen as important that's what all these brands do when Porsche and Mercedes they advertise as a businessman Mr businessman getting in his car has his briefcase Mr business he's important you're not important you're no por you're You're Nobody you're a loser you have to play to people's insecurities the cam business was the number one for this play to people's insecurities and promise with your product that everything's going to be better so I'll give you an example so with the cam girls guys would come along the guys who are talking to the cam girls can't really get girls obviously because otherwise they wouldn't be there so they can't really get girls but our cam girl would tell them that they could get girls or that they could get them so let's say the guy would come along and say oh so uh what kind of what kind of guys do you like the cam girl would describe that guy and this is something I had to train my girls to do because girls are so stupid so like literally a fat old man would come along and say what kind of guys do you like and she'd be like young fit Italian men or something dumb and obviously he'd be like well that's not me so there's not going to be a relationship there is there whereas if a fat old man say what kind of guys do you like she'd be like oh someone mature someone who's done playing games someone who's ready to settle down will value me all the [\\xa0__\\xa0] that he wants to hear Sell people what they want play on their insecurities and he's sitting there going yeah well I I've been trying to look for a girl like that my whole life but I just can't find him oh where are you based if we keep talking maybe one day we'll meet one year later two years later taking his money taking his money taking his money you have to play on people's insecurities and you have to find out exactly what people want so I don't know what you're going to sell and it doesn't matter what you're going to sell what you going to sell why do people want it I'm right now we're in a university you guys want it because you want to learn how to make money that's why so in all of my advertising and all everything I'm doing I make it very very clear to you you need this to learn how to make money I know more about business than you I've run more businesses than you have if you don't get what I have if you don't get the hustlers University you're not going to know what I know so you're not going to make money like I make money I identified the re it's the product we have it here I identified the reason you're buying it and I'm pushing it pushing it pushing it so I don't know what you're going to sell say you're selling [\\xa0__\\xa0] protein shakes I don't know you don't sell a lot of people will sell a protein shake best flavor this much carbs this much sugar blah blah blah who cares it's boring if you're going to sell your protein shake I'm going to draw a protein shake I'm going to draw one it's going to be artistic and beautiful if you're selling protein shakes you need to say to people you won't be strong when without the protein shake you won't be fit without my product why are you wasting your time in the gym when you're not going to get you're not going to get in good shape anyway oh you'll get in shape but you'll be in better shape if you use my product [\\xa0__\\xa0] the product who cares what's in the product sell the result you need this you need this because of XY Z doesn't matter if you're selling protein shakes or the husters University or [\\xa0__\\xa0] raspberries doesn't matter what it is you have to push that point over and over and over again play on people's insecurities that's what makes people buy cuz we not going to buy otherwise oh I could go to the gym and I'll get in shape and oh do I need more carbs I don't know no who cares it's all dork [\\xa0__\\xa0] the OD geek will care but most people don't care you need protein shakes or your gym time is a waste of time why are you suffering in the gym for no reason if you drink this one drink you're not wasting your time anymore stop being a loser quickly buy it's how you have to be play on people's insecurities all the time next this is a really important one and this feeds into one of the points I made earlier about the coffee shop Let's imagine you go in the coffee shop you probably unless you're a complete laner are not going in there by yourself the people you're going in the coffee shop with should be the people doing the same thing you do analyzing the price of things analyzing the rent analyzing how much the coffees cost how much did the staff cost can money be made here could we make more money if we open somewhere next door is there any gaps on the market are there any mistakes they're making identifying problems Etc everyone you roll with should be thinking about money the lesson number 21 is network is everything this is super important if you're a loser and you're rolling with losers you are going to stay I'll write this down in case you [\\xa0__\\xa0] don't believe me so I'm make this extremely clear to you if you're a loser and you're rolling with losers you are going to stay a loser I don't know if you can see that you're G to stay a loser underline losers roll with losers and winners roll with winners number 21 network is everything the people around you need to be thinking about money thinking about hustling if they're not you don't need to talk to them I hear this all the time oh but he's my friend we like hanging out hanging out why to do what play video games make jokes huh ha he's so funny haha haa jerk each other off [\\xa0__\\xa0] you doing if your friends aren't talking about money why you talking to them this is why I started the war room if you're watching this and you're not in the War Room get inside everyone in there is hustling everyone in there is interested in increasing their income and changing their lives that is the point of a network to increase your life you're a node in the network that's how networks work you got nodes and you got links you come into the network you're a node you know people you help them they help you Etc network is everything and in my networking Brilliance course if you don't have that as well I teach you how to meet highle people and how to make high level people like you how to have highle friends how to get multi-millionaire friends Etc how to pitch them for investment all that I teach that all in the network Brilliance course so you got the War Room the network Brilliance course that will help you with this if you haven't got them yet get them because they're going to help you you need a network around you you need people on your phone who are talking about money and doing important things you need to be in with them that needs to be your network if you're rolling with a bunch of video game playing losers you're going to stay a video game playing loser this is super important your network has to change if you want to really become a hustler everyone around you needs to have a hustle even if all the people around you don't have hustles remember what I said earlier about finding free staff okay let's say all your friends are losers well now you've got a brilliant idea so now you're the leader I want to run this company you're G to do this you're gonna do this you're gonna do this if they all sit there and go no I'm tired I don't have time BL blah blah then these people are completely useless they're wasters get rid of them they either agree to work for you or [\\xa0__\\xa0] them off find some new friends join the War Room in the War Room you can link up with people all around the world who are getting [\\xa0__\\xa0] done get the network Brilliance course learn how to get [\\xa0__\\xa0] important friends your network is everything I don't answer the phone to broke boys you call my phone if I answer that dude's important when broke boys call me it gets ignored all rich people are the same I cannot stand being around people who are not on a mission to get rich that is the only Mission I'm interested in everyone I hang around with is on the same Mission we ain't got time for no dumb [\\xa0__\\xa0] so if you're still participating in dumb [\\xa0__\\xa0] you have got to change your mindset absolutely if your Network's full of losers employ them if they refuse to work for you [\\xa0__\\xa0] them off find new friends if you can't find friends the War Room will give you a network instantly that's the whole point of the War Room International network of money makers not playing any [\\xa0__\\xa0] games in the war room right next Point number 22 keep your panties dry till the big guy's hard so too many people get excited about business they ain't got or excited about business they do have this is just Monetary Exchange gentlemen you have to be a [\\xa0__\\xa0] professional James Bond may enjoy [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] but you don't see him excited about [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] he enjoys it but he ain't excited he's smooth he's cool he's never giddy about it you launch your business you start to see some money coming in money's coming in you're making some sales good be happy be proud of yourself but don't be giddy be like oh wow don't be going to see clients like I can't wait I really want to work it's going to be so much fun this is numbers on a screen gentlemen it's all this [\\xa0__\\xa0] is numbers on a screen you're moving numbers around let me get rid of the big loser sign before one of you guys start crying you called me a loser you are a [\\xa0__\\xa0] loser learn some emotional control don't be getting all giddy and [\\xa0__\\xa0] keep your pantties dry till the big guy's hard don't know why I wrote that down but that's the basic lesson here I see so people get Giddy and excited oh we might get this much money one you haven't got the money yet two even if you got the money good all you have to do do you know what you have to do when money comes in the door let me tell you [\\xa0__\\xa0] because maybe you don't know this is me here's my muscles again money comes into the door on Tuesday on Wednesday do you know what I do I wake up and I try and find some more [\\xa0__\\xa0] money don't worry about don't be getting excited about money because when money comes in that's a that's you could you're allowed two or three seconds of excitement when you check the bank then it doesn't exist anymore here okay there now it's done this is done it's in it's done it's gone even if I still save it it's effectively gone you have to find a way to make more you shouldn't be getting excited about big chunks of money or any chunks of money you should always be pushing for more more more more more don't be get excited about what you've already achieved you can't live in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] past second that the business is done is the past living in the past is going to sync your business you have to live in the future constantly pushing for more I wake up every day broke every day I wake up at zero poor every [\\xa0__\\xa0] day no matter how much money I've made the day before that's not how I operate every day is a new day you wake up broke do not be getting Giddy and excited and emotional oh but last week we had a really good week who cares that was last week last week [\\xa0__\\xa0] Iran hadn't attacked an American army base in Iraq last week was a different [\\xa0__\\xa0] world this is this week shit's different don't be getting excited about old [\\xa0__\\xa0] every single day you are poor every single day you need to attack and go again every single day from [\\xa0__\\xa0] every day you wake up at zero don't be getting Giddy and excited and emotional about money you've already made or money you might make which is even worse I used to know so many sales guys when I worked at uh TriStar the first TV company before I went to run T2 so many sales guys would be [\\xa0__\\xa0] in the office laughing drinking their coffee talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] saying oh I've got four really good leads I've got four really good pitches they should be coming in today laughing about money that they thought was coming that they hadn't made yet and even if all four came in which it never happened two came in even if four came in the time they're wasting being happy [\\xa0__\\xa0] around they could have found more don't [\\xa0__\\xa0] waste time counting money that you ain't got yet or counting money you've already got you live right now in the present right now in the I'm going to draw another diagram I'm starting to get happy with my diagrams now I think my Art's getting better do you think my Art's getting better I think it's getting better so my Art's getting really good so because my Art's getting good we're going to draw another diagram I want you [\\xa0__\\xa0] to understand something so this is you this is the past this is the future you're looking this way this [\\xa0__\\xa0] doesn't matter anymore it's come it's gone even if it's still in the bank even if it's $10 million it doesn't matter it's over it's finished you should never be looking that way should always be chasing more more more more more and you should be living here in the present when I say chasing I don't mean excited for I mean get you need to get it from here move it to here and forget about it more more more more more if I have a really really good day with Cam when I had really good days with Cam sometimes girl I had all my girls online it was popping every room was busy the girls had like healthy competition between each other and all their clients were trying to help them win tip War and it was going off and we made [\\xa0__\\xa0] 12 $133,000 in a day profit for me after I paid the girls and everything really really busy the next day I'd wake up and every [\\xa0__\\xa0] girl was lazy oh we did really good yesterday well can we have to day off or they'd go online they'd half ass it and I'm like no no no yesterday's done yeah it was a good day but it's over today is a new day today you're on zero oh but yesterday I made so much yesterday I don't live in yesterday I live in today and the only day that's coming for me is tomorrow yesterday is gone you have to be that way with money so many business people will do a little bit of business and [\\xa0__\\xa0] sit on their ass there's some dork on Twitter called Kyle trouble Kyle trouble such a stupid name and I could just tell by his whole face he's a nerd and the guy is [\\xa0__\\xa0] on Twitter going oh I had a really bad year I took my foot off the gas you want to teach people about business and he's saying publicly on Twitter that he made a little bit of money so he became a lazy piece of [\\xa0__\\xa0] and then then his money ran out or his business fell apart and now he's broke you [\\xa0__\\xa0] dumb lazy so he can sit around in this apartment getting jerked off by his three girlfriend like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] wrong with people this this [\\xa0__\\xa0] this put it here forget about it more more more next next next I don't care how big of a deal you do I don't care how many tokens you make online cam girl I don't care what happened yesterday it's over you have to push forward at all times I've seen so many people do a little bit of business and end up [\\xa0__\\xa0] changing their attitude to money oh I've got some money now no you don't have [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's yesterday's money you need to get today's money right next 23 this is important very important because this is a business hack I learn so I'm G to clean my board I'm gonna teach you my business hack that nobody does you're about to learn something that nobody does only I do and it works [\\xa0__\\xa0] brilliantly it works brilliantly check this out my business hack is drum roll send people their money back they love that [\\xa0__\\xa0] so check this how many times have you bought something and you really wanted it but then you kind of looked at your bank afterwards and thought I was expensive what bit of a waste of money do you know what I mean so what I used to do when I sold advertising was I had this trick where I'd sell a package let's say I don't know 2,000 they'd sell I'd sell it they'd buy it they'd buy when the invoice come in I'd call them up and go hey uh this is Andrew tapate from N2 like oh hi Andrew I say yeah I just want to let you know that some things have changed I don't think now is optimal time for you to start your advertising I'm interested in this as much as you are I have invested interest in this working I don't want to just take your money I want to make sure that this pays off for both of us because if it pays off for both of us we can do a lot of business in the future I think it'd be better to wait about two weeks in two weeks from now I think there going to be a better opportunity so what I'm going to do is I'm going to send you your money back now I don't want to sit on your money it's your money we can still do the campaign I just think if we wait a week maybe two not very long I think there's going be some more opportunities in the market and they' be like oh okay yeah all right that's what you think I said yeah I want this to work I want to you know I've been doing this a long time I want to make sure this is very good for both of us blah blah blah and I'd send them their money back and they'd be like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] I tried to buy and he he gave me my money back it's kind of like a takeaway you know the takeaway trick I tried to buy it and he said no and he gave me my money back and now they trust you loads because no one gives refunds no one gives money back so he gave me my money back then when I called him a week later and said bang now it's time to do business I got a fantastic opportunity we're going to do this we're going to do this we're going to do this we have this Gap that Gap it's only 3,000 markers still working every [\\xa0__\\xa0] time they buy they' be like oh that's more I say yeah I know it's more than last time I mean we can do the 2,000 package now but there's a really good opportunity here you build so much trust when you send the money back that they will spend more later I did this trick with every [\\xa0__\\xa0] customer every client would buy pay call them up now's not the right time send them their money back back talk some [\\xa0__\\xa0] about how I'm really looking after them how I want a really good relationship blah blah blah blah blah and then hit them up for a bigger invoice every [\\xa0__\\xa0] time and it always worked it works because the trust you build when you send someone their money back is immense because no one does that nobody does that remember what I said earlier about there's only a hundred people on Twitter who want to buy a [\\xa0__\\xa0] ebook it's the same with everything so my logic was this I'm making phone calls all day for N2 on the days I worked let's say I make a 100 phone calls only one of those people is in a position to buy something the other 99 are never going to buy no matter what I say so that one person who buys I had to make as much money as possible what was I teaching earlier one of the lessons earlier they don't buy on price you have to get people to buy things expensive so that one person who bought for 2,000 the only way I can make more money is to get him to pay for more there's only one customer that day and this was the system I developed the send the money back system and it's fantastic so even if you're selling $17 ebooks let people buy for $17 email them and say you know what uh I'm going to update the ebook now so I'm going to send you your money back I'm send you your money back because the ebooks going to be updated I want you to have the most updated version here's your let me know how to pay you email them personally so they have to see it and reply don't just click refund they might not know this let them look at that and go okay oh yeah okay send the money here send them their 17 bucks back then they'll be like okay that was weird then email again hey let you know working on the update it's going to be out soon I think you're really going to like it I could have and then remind them I could have left you with the older version but I think it'd be better to have the most upto-date stuff bang email him again watch that person go oh yeah you know I really appreciate that most people wouldn't do that most people wouldn't care because now you've sent them their money back this person is in you don't understand the psychological effect this has on people now they're like whoa I can trust this dude then you come at them and go hey so it's updated I've updated I'm going to give you the latest version as well as that I've got a new product that's coming out it's not out yet it's blah blah blah blah it's worth $100 D if you're interested in both I can give you both for 40 bang I guarantee you he buys it you've turned a $17 sale into a $40 sale with a two-day weight and a [\\xa0__\\xa0] two emails you've doubled your turnover you've doubled your turnover do you have any idea how important that is you've doubled your turnover by with a two-day wait and a couple emails and a [\\xa0__\\xa0] story you ain't gonna update anything because they've never seen the original ebooks they don't know if it's updated or not you just have to add on another ebook you already had a big famous famous is the word I invented in T2 famous you take the money famous them you famous a goose and you fam the geese this is business listen he's the goose you famous him you famous him by taking his $17 emailing him sending it back promising a whole bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] updates then saying you can get a bundle worth 120 for 40 because he waited and you apologize for the weight like you're doing him a [\\xa0__\\xa0] favor I know you bought two days ago I've updated the ebook now I know you've done a bit of a weight so if you want my $100 product for only an extra 20 I'll give you both for 4 e sorry for the the delay oh he's oh he's doing me a favor yeah okay he gave me the update and I got his ebook from fam moose the goose bang doubled your turnover and it only works because you send that money back when you send people their money back I guarantee you it changes how they think so that's a trick you need to start implementing finding ways you can send people their money back CU that [\\xa0__\\xa0] works trust me I did that for a very very long time especially with low value products with 17 bucks you ain't making no money on 17 bucks send that back aim for 40s or 50s that's how you get paid all it takes is a few emails in between keep a spreadsheet so you don't get confused be moderately organized it's easier to double your turnover as a business this way than any other way there's no easier way to double your turnover trying to get double the customers at 17 is going to be a lot harder than just [\\xa0__\\xa0] a couple emails and doubling your turnover double I've just doubled your business with a very simple trick I'm a genius I'm a genius I'm a genius and I know this [\\xa0__\\xa0] works I did it all my [\\xa0__\\xa0] self I've done this I'm a genius literally I used to do this all the time with advertising oh I've just bought yeah yeah I'm gonna send it back now's not the right time oh but we really want to do it it's part of our marketing strategy yeah okay I'll be in touch don't worry I'm going to identify the right time bang higher price 24 you have to hard close now a lot of people already understand this this is why they do false urgency buy now running out of time blah blah blah but you have to hard close people because people don't buy things without being hard closed so you have to find a way to close them you either have to do the false urgency thing we're running out of time or you can just do you can do uh if you don't buy now it's GNA be very hard to get this deal later on blah blah blah now everyone knows this this is very basic sales but in my experience I've tried soft closing and I've tried hard closing hard closing is better with hard closing you're going to lose some people the people you close outshine or outweigh is

no Mayes you got clothes you got people out there if they want to do business with you they either do or they don't everyone's a maybe maybe I'll go to the Moon right now I'm a may maybe I'm a [\\xa0__\\xa0] astronaut it doesn't mean anything till NASA calls me up and says get on the [\\xa0__\\xa0] rocket am I an astronaut or not too many of you are letting [\\xa0__\\xa0] maybe [\\xa0__\\xa0] around and don't do that next Point talking about maybe number 25 and I think a lot of people already know this but I'm going to say it anyway business ain't real till they pay we're all wait wa we're on number 25 we're only a quarter of the way through think I'm much [\\xa0__\\xa0] you've learned in this University or a quarter of the way through 25 it ain't real till they pay and I mean money in the bank so when I was running vixel remember vixel my TV company that I was running at the same time I was working at N2 I had the chance to land a deal for a company called glorious Foods is glorious Foods still a company let me have a look I'm curious glorious Foods gee and what they did is they had food brands in Superstores in the UK glorious Foods Glorious Food yeah oh no this is a k error [\\xa0__\\xa0] anyway they were a very big company so Tristan called and pitched glorious foods for TV spoke to a junior marketing manager convinced her TV was a fantastic idea we're talking about sponsorships on the Food Channel blah blah blah blah anyway this was a 600,000 pound deal with a quarter of a million pounds profit from the interest quarter of a million so he convinces our TV is a good idea blah blah blah organize a meeting I go up to the meeting in the meeting I meet the head of marketing the big boss and this little loser that Tristan F on the phone I do the meeting and I destroy it because I'm a G it was beautiful completely destroyed the meeting from head to toe bang did it they loved me they loved it they wanted to do business I sent them the proposed advertising plan they loved it I sent them the contract they loved it the deal was done me and T it was done and when I say done I know you don't count money till it's in the bank but it was done they'd emailed back yes no problem they'd signed the contract the deal was done we were just waiting for the money to show in the bank anyway so we're emailing emailing emailing the head the head of marking whatever whatever got sick so when you emailed her it came back saying hi unexpected Ed leave da I'm dying of some [\\xa0__\\xa0] disease whatever she got sick the Junior market manager had no power and it turns out the big managing director didn't want to start TV campaign when the when the uh market manager was away so he just wouldn't pay the invoice stop [\\xa0__\\xa0] them sue me because he knew they were so big this is like a billion pound company that we couldn't sue them like I know they signed the contract what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] we really going to do about it like we're just me and my brother take them to court waste our time and money [\\xa0__\\xa0] so we're sitting there waiting for money and guess what it never comes until the money's in the bank it ain't real doesn't matter if they signed a contract doesn't matter if they said yes doesn't matter if they agreed to everything doesn't matter if you've started the work nothing matters until money is in the bank this is super important because me and Tristan when we realized Glorious Food money wasn't coming that was the closest I've ever come to feeling genuine depression in a very long time we were so excited about that money we did exactly what I said don't do we got giddy we weren't professional we were excited quarter of a mill liquid cash what can we do we can do this we can go there buy this buy that change our lives all this [\\xa0__\\xa0] we weren't Rich then that's Court that's life changing money do not get excited about money till it's in the bank super super important because trust me that Glorious Food thing [\\xa0__\\xa0] me up for like a week I couldn't even work properly for a week I was so pissed off totally demotivated don't let that happen to you and that feeds into part the next part number 26 stress tolerance you need to learn to care about about things mentally but not emotionally how successful you are as a hustler is directly linked to how much stress you can tolerate money making is only stress tolerance so when you're making money most of the time what you're doing is you're taking stress off other people especially if you provide a service even if it's a cleaning service you're taking away stress from someone else you're adopting someone else's stress for cash The more stress you can adopt the more money you can take you need to have high stress tolerance as a hustler as a money maker as a businessman you have to be able to deal with stress things are going to go wrong all the [\\xa0__\\xa0] time you have to be able to just ride the waves so in life usually there's two kinds of people you have the stoner [\\xa0__\\xa0] who smokes wheed who doesn't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about anything who gets nowhere and you have the person who cares about things but is very emotional very uptight oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] sake oh this has gone wrong angry blah blah blah running around like a a nutcase you don't want to be either of them you want to be in the middle you have to care about things mentally but not emotionally and Andrew the website's gone down and PayPal have blocked us and whatever whatever whatever you need to sit there and go okay yeah all right I understand let's find a solution dot dot dot dot and you need to care mentally but not be getting emotional about it stress tolerance is a huge aspect of this most of you people out there the only reason you're not successful is because you can't tolerate stress and I'm saying this to you now you cannot tolerate stress what do you mean I know you can't because if you could you'd already have side businesses and you don't you work a job and you don't have side businesses because oh I'm busy I'm tired this is sales stress tolerance needing to sleep is stress that shows you have a low stress tolerance not having the energy shows you have a low stress to not knowing what to do it's a low stress tolerance you do know what to do you have ideas you're just lazy and you're just afraid of the effort and you don't like the idea of stress oh now I got more things to do I can't handle it more things you're a little [\\xa0__\\xa0] baby stress tolerance is super important life's stressful being successful is stressful I have eight super on the drive and it it's all stress to [\\xa0__\\xa0] get them and I enjoy them when I drive them and I wouldn't have it any other way you have to increase your stress tolerance you're going to be stressed you have to learn to do more things and deal with more [\\xa0__\\xa0] increase your stress tolerance if you're watching this right now I don't care what position you're in start a company today and deal with the [\\xa0__\\xa0] the quicker you get better at swimming through [\\xa0__\\xa0] the quicker you're going to get through the [\\xa0__\\xa0] into the end which is money stress tolerance is super super important I can't stress that enough 27 I kind of touched on this earlier with the protein shake so let's draw the protein shake again because I kind of touched on this earlier but it's an important Point how was my beautiful protein shake it was really nice I'm see if I can do it as good as before label a lid that's good so protein shakes the way you sell protein shakes is you convince people they need them this is the most one of the most basic tenants of business you have to convince people they need whatever you sell you don't talk about the product you talk about their need what's the old adage that they do sell me this pen have you ever heard that before sell me this pen people go oh well this pen is blue and this pen is uh you can uh it's it's made of plastic and it's durable no it's not it's not how you sell a pen sell me this pen you need to be able to write things down but I've already got a pen yeah but now you can write more things down you have another pen how you GNA write down all your ideas think of all the things you can write down you can write the next novel you can become JK Rolland you can become a billionaire if you had a pen you don't have a pen you need a pen to write things down sell the need don't sell the product it's blue and it's plastic as opposed to you can become JK Rolland because you need a pen to write things down you have to sell the need at all times most people don't sell the need have you noticed with me I never sell I never sell the product so let's look at my products compared to other dorks who sell stuff online so you'll see other dorks will go my 18 page my 18 page ebook can includes blah blah blah blah have I ever told you how many pages are in my books or how many or how many exact modules you're getting did you know how many modules you were getting with this university did I say this many videos this this this this this no cuz that's selling the product and you don't care you signed up anyway if I would have said 10 videos of this and a eBook and PDFs who cares I sold you the need you need to know what I know about business it's the need that sells not the product so whatever you're selling it doesn't matter what it is sell the need even if you're selling [\\xa0__\\xa0] raspberries they need raspberries why do I need raspberries you need raspberries because of [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's good for your I don't know immune system talk to [\\xa0__\\xa0] super berries whatever that's what Goji berries do what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is a GOI Berry I I've never heard of a goji berry now I see them everywhere superfood Goji berries the superfood superfood why am i g I ate Goji berries I feel exactly the same it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] but they sell on need superfood you need Goji berries all of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] sudden know what they I don't know what they look like Anyway sell the need at all times you will catch yourself not selling the need all the times you'll catch yourself not selling the need so even a coffee shop this is the biggest mistake things like coffee shops make they don't sell the need they'll sell on a coffee shop will sell you on price they'll try and do it nice and cheap because they have lots of competition they'll sell they'll have a nice looking coffee shop they'll have like a good you know nice chair that'll look nice whatever whatever but they very rarely sell the need if I had a coffee shop I would have a massive sign outside saying tired question mark nice warm coffee the need because everyone's tired aren't they everyone's stressed everyone's going through life tired a bit nice warm coffee yeah nice warm coffee okay walk in that's selling the need I don't say araba beans in a cup who gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] care about [\\xa0__\\xa0] beans sell the need at all times Never Take Your Eye Off that prize if you're still paying attention which you [\\xa0__\\xa0] should be write that down already all the information I've given you should be formulating how you view business you might have to watch this University three or four times but at the core of it always you have money in that's your business the rest is [\\xa0__\\xa0] everything has to feed back to this selling the need will feed back to this people buy things they need they sometimes buy things they want but they always buy things they need that's why they have to need what you sell so find a way to make them need it next this is something that most people don't understand my experience of business if you're going to be a hustler you're trying to get rich is as follows until you are a big rich company so or until you have lots of money in the bank contracts are not real legal paperwork are not real none of these things are real look at the Glorious Foods example they signed the contract they owed me that money if I would have taken them to court I would have spent a lot of money and would they have paid me in the end no none of these things are real do you know why legality isn't real because legality defies rule one of the hustlers University what's rule one rule one is speed and guess what lawsuits are slow super slow and if you're a new business you do not have time to be [\\xa0__\\xa0] suing people it's going to take forever years years for a maybe and even if you do get a yes they can still delay years if they even pay you which they probably won't it's different if you're like suing a huge n news Outlet or something you know like the Covington kids did that's different but in general you want to do your business based on trust and cash you don't want to be having oh I don't really trust all the contracts well I've got the contract I've got the contract if they don't want to pay you they're not going to pay you [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] your contract and what you really going to do about it [\\xa0__\\xa0] I am not a fan of contracts I don't work with contracts I don't like legality it's very very slow so if you're looking to start your business you're like okay we need a contract with this person contract with that person you know what's better than contracts mutual interest it's good for me if I do my part it's good for him if he does his part look at how a road Works you're driving down the road there's car here there's a car here why do they not crash into each other well it's good for him if they don't crash and it's good for him if they don't crash nobody want wants to crash so we all avoid it isn't that better than having a contract saying we won't crash the [\\xa0__\\xa0] does contract me and then he does crash into me well I have the contract but the crash has already happened and everything's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] mess mutual interest find a way to do business people is mutual interest my suppliers I don't need a contract from my supplier because they want me to buy things from them what contract for what I see so many people who get involved in business start talking about contracts because they like to sound smart very much like we were talking about earlier on about people who like to spend money at the beginning and get their their logo and spend money and get a big back end and all this [\\xa0__\\xa0] they like to sound intelligent that's not business this is business money in the rest ain't business contracts aren't business contracts are just some [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] you might have to deal with when you get bigger but in general don't be thinking if I can get him to sign a contract then I've got it you haven't got anything you got piece of paper and if you try and enforce that contract it's going to bankrupt you so don't be relying on contracts any way I a lot of people doing that and I don't know why a piece of paper doesn't mean [\\xa0__\\xa0] unless you enforce it and enforcement is very very slow and very very expensive so forget about contracts find a way if you're going to have to work with another company or another person for there to be mutual interest Mutual self-interest keeps the traffic of the world flowing it keeps the business World flowing too that whole suing each other [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's some mess you don't want to get mixed up in that ain't going to get you rich Hustlers are looking to get money you're looking to do this suing people is a big [\\xa0__\\xa0] outlay for a long long time it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] contracts make sure your partners need you and make sure you need your partners this is a very very important one so I used to know a guy hopefully he doesn't buy this course I knew a guy I don't know the exact business he had it was something to do with uh self-employed employees uh to avoid them having to pay tax or something they they'd use his company and he helped them all under one umbrella company pay less tax something like this I don't understand it was in England but there was him and two other partners there's three of them in total and one day he went into work and his two partners had [\\xa0__\\xa0] him over and screwed him out of his own company because they had the majority share 33% each 66% they [\\xa0__\\xa0] him off and got rid of him why did they get rid of him because they didn't need him anymore didn't need him anymore you need to make sure your partners always need you and you need to make sure you always need your partners not want need if you look at your partners and realize they don't need you or you don't need them then you should do it on your own and stop being a [\\xa0__\\xa0] stop being a coward because you can be the absolute managing director and you could find a your number one employee from your old company or someone you really trust and make them your number two in command now you effectively have a partner this is another thing you don't understand people sorry people want partners because they like the idea of having someone to vibe off of or work with or someone who they can uh check their thinking with that's fine if you if you have a partner and you both need each other and it's 50/50 good I'm not saying don't have Partners I have Partners in some of my companies however you can still have all the benefits of a partner with a number two in command who's loyal to you now you still have benefits of a partner but you control everything so make sure you need your partners and they need you there's lots of ways you can do that Mutual self-interest you can do things they can do things you need to work together to get the job done otherwise feel free to just hire someone and make sure they're your second of command and just make them feel important and use them to bounce your thinking and be the only control person who's a control they'll get [\\xa0__\\xa0] out your company not that it's likely to happen but still even if you're making loads of money you have a partner you don't need now you have half the amount of money you're making why next Point business number 30 every purchase is an impulse purchase so if someone does eventually buy from you even if they've been thinking about it for a long time the moment they finally decide to pull the trigger and buy is an impulse purchase that's why I say hard cloes that's why people do false scar City all these things try and and get them to impulse buy you can go and do a lot of research on impulse purchases how they work why people make them Etc everybody after they purchase the time between the money leaving the bank and them receiving the product even if it's a few milliseconds is going to have that little bit of it's a lot of money I just spent every single purchase is an impulse purchase remember that keep it in mind I've had a lot of people say to me oh you're selling impulse purchases I don't mine is a considered purchase no no it's an impulse purchase a house is an impulse purchase a Supercar is an impulse purchase at the point of buying it's an impulse purchase no matter how long they consider it for when they finally click Send it's an impulse purchase so all the tactics and tricks I'm teaching you to get people to impulsively buy work on every single kind of sale because every single kind of sale is an impulse purchase don't get stuck up in some [\\xa0__\\xa0] thinking oh mine's not an impul like you're better than everyone else oh mine's not impulse purchase mine's considered shut up it's all impulse purchasing all of it everybody impulse purchases and that's why you have to look if you're look at any kind of sales tips and tricks look at impulse purchasing how it works why people do it and those are the factors you need to implement especially when you're trying to close a considered purchase you've been talking to them for a long time you're trying to close them bang you're trying to con you're trying to convince them to make an impulse purchase it's as simple as that all sales are impulse purchases and they're not buying on price those two go together very very well remember those two points it's important so how does a real estate agent do that like a house is a considered purchase this is where you're going to live and it's very very expensive well they come and they show you around they make you want it and then they start telling you other people have want it other people are view in the house they're going to put in an offer trying to force you to make an Impulse yes or no uh uh okay we'll take it they understand everyone understands there's always an impulse purchase you have to put something there to make people buy make them do it or they're simply not going to do it do not give people open-ended time frames if I say you can have this pen today for x amount or you can come at back to me anytime time and get the pen no no rush why would I buy now I I'll live without the pen for a while until I really need the pen and I'm not going to need the pen unless you convince me of the needs so I'm never going to buy the pen everything's an impulse purchase you have to convince them on needs and you have to Har close them this is something just understand the nature of how people sell and how people buy because this is the same with absolutely everything no matter what it is next promise your clients a future this is important a lot of people I see do not sell a future with their clients and I don't understand why you should sell a future with your clients you should say look we're going to work together for a very long time in the future XY Z's going to happen in the future I'll be able to provide you with XY Z when you talk about the future you presume the you presume the present so this is a trick I even do with chicks let's use dating as an example if you're watching this and you don't have my PhD course get it because it's good very good but uh I do this in the PHD course so if you preempt the future if you talk talking about what the future then you've already assumed the present so if you're talking to somebody or you want to do some business with somebody and you got a business or whatever whatever and you want to uh uh sell them something you talk about how it's going to affect things in the future so let's take an example let's let's look at your uh your ebook I don't know I'm just thinking something I'll talk at your $17 ebook on how to pick up girls girls I'm going to draw a girl there go she's hair beautiful smile so how do you preempt the future to make sure that they buy so let's say you're talking to someone they're not sure if they're going to buy or not well then you talk about the future you say well in the future maybe we can go day gaming together all pickup artist [\\xa0__\\xa0] but whatever in the future we can go day gaming together or in the future if you're texting a girl and you're not sure exactly what to say let me know or in the future if you see a girl doing some of the things I point out in my ebook send me examples because I can use them my website really appreciate that talk about the future like he's already bought and digested the product and that makes them far more likely to buy and digest your product say I do the same thing when I date girls oh when we're married how do I know you're going to be how do I know you're not going to cheat [\\xa0__\\xa0] I've just met her what do you mean married hahaa if you're talking about ha when we're married that's presuming I'm going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] you sooner or later because we're going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] before we get married presume the future presuming the future makes the present you you're setting the T you're setting what the present's going to be you're saying this is what's going to happen now so I know what's going to happen in the future you can do exactly the same thing with business so when I was selling TV advertising I was talking to clients and I'm trying to close a small 19 Grand deal I'd be talking about two years when we're doing the uh 500 Grand deals so when I'm trying to close this I'm talking about this I'll be like oh in the future well in in a few years we're launching the big campaigns we can do the sponsorships we can sponsor the before and after the programs and when you're spending that kind of money we'll also be able to have meetings directly with the channel blah blah blah blah and they're sitting there going yeah okay yeah sponsorships yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah talking about all this imaginary [\\xa0__\\xa0] to try and close this sell the future at all times if you presume the future it makes them more likely to buy now and that's something that people don't do even for [\\xa0__\\xa0] $17 ebooks for television advertising for websites doesn't matter what it is if I was trying to sell a new website for N2 I'd be talking about how two years later down the line we can integrate a new back end with our website who knows who gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] talk about some fancy [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's going to happen in the future if you do that you're more likely to sell now that's super important don't talk about now back to the ebook if you buy buy my ebook you'll see what girls are texting you and you'll see why they mean it or why they're saying it if you buy my ebook you'll see why girls are saying what they say in text messages as opposed to after you've seen my ebook and you see what these girls are saying it's going to be exactly like I told you and when they do it screenshot it send it to me because you're going to see the future okay after I after I have the ebook then I'm going to know he said I'm going to understand why they're doing it I'm going to send it to him you've already told him he has the ebook presume the future at all times very important next number 32 is something I've already been discussing at length accidentally what happens is when your brain like mine is a plethora of knowledge you end up tapping into things

but you have to develop an angle to be engaging so next time you talk to someone who's an engaging speaker find out why they're engaging even some people are engaging because they laugh all the time

find this is a staff tip number 41 and clear my board no more tits sorry if you've been jerking off enjoying my beautiful pornography but she's got to go number 41 everything I know about business from start to [\\xa0__\\xa0] finish every single business I run I run by these principles every single business I run I run by these principles literally every single one of them 41 if you can find a loyal person find them a job so most people approach recruitment like I have a job I need to fill let me find a person I approach recruitment the other way around I try my best to go through life as I interact with people if I find a person who I believe would be a good fit for my leadership style which is do whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] I say and do it quickly then I'll find them work you can always find more work the work is never done work is a black hole even if it's just to sit on my Twitter account and retweet tweets all day it's still work still engagement still attention still advertising if I find someone who fits my style and I believe they'd be a good worker and they're loyal to me and I know I'm be able to count on them I'll find work for them don't turn down people you think will be good because you can't find work if you're running a business and you can't think of work to do for an employee then you shouldn't running a business it's very easy to find work there's always something to do there always Twitter to tweet or blogs to write or go on Reddit and post forums and post [\\xa0__\\xa0] with links to your product there's always something to do if you find a good person hire them and find a job afterwards that's key and then as Jobs real jobs appear in your organization as you grow you'll already have loyal members of Staff you can reorganize don't throw away loyal people because you don't know exactly what they're going to do straight away that's 41 42 aim way too high and when I say way too high I mean way too high now don't be one of those jackasses that comes along going yeah I'm like on Dragon's Den or some [\\xa0__\\xa0] or The Apprentice I'm have a business worth $500 million I'm going to be a multi-millionaire don't be an idiot but you need to aim too high the higher you aim the higher you'll get if you aim for the moon you'll get to the Stars if you aim for the Stars you'll get to the sky if you aim for the sky you won't get off the ground that's how it goes you need to aim high be realistic don't be a dick but you do need to aim too high whatever your expectations are you need to Triple at least quadruple because if your product is good and you're doing a good job and you're selling it to the whole world why can't you be a billionaire why not if you're doing a good job and selling a good product to the whole world why couldn't you so you need to aim much higher than you're currently aiming it's going to help you reach higher levels just don't be one of them deluded [\\xa0__\\xa0] who's already talking about half a million dollar turnover when he has literally sold zero I guess another way to phrase this lesson number 42 is never be content so when your money's coming in let's say you get to the point where you're doing 2,000 a day $1,000 a day whatever never sit there and go oh that's pretty good it's never good it's never good enough ever It's never enough it's never good enough It's never enough to make you happy be greedy want more aim high all the time it's your instant source of motivation if you're happy and content with what's coming in you're not going to aim high enough you have to be pushing forward remember always look into the new money forget the old money aim higher all of the time I can't stress that enough next lesson irrational self-confidence without being a bullshitter people like confidence if I'm going to spend my money with you I want you to be extremely confident on what you're doing with my money if I'm gonna okay so let's say I'm going in for surgery I'm G to go see a doctor for surgery do I want that doctor to be confident about the operation or nervous do I want the doctor to say yeah I've done this loads of times yeah I know exactly what we're going to do here yeah it's easy it's simple I've done it loads of times or do I want them to be like oh well yeah I mean things can go wrong and you know you know I didn't sleep last night what do you want you want confidence so if someone's going to spend money with you they want you to be confident all the time so you have to be confident in your delivery now don't be a bullshitter don't come along and say I know more about girls than Andrew hate because everyone's gonna know you're an idiot because you don't anyone who seen the PHD course knows that but still you need to be super confident at all times so if anyone's going to spend money with you they need to be confident so when I used to go into sales when I would uh go sell things when I was doing television advertising I would say I was the best say I was the best now I was relatively new to the game and I say yeah I've been in this game a long time I've met a lot of people and I've met a lot of agencies to see how they do things I'm really I'm not I'm I'm not trying to sound conceded but I'm very sure that we are the best in what we do and they be like okay I was like no really we are the best of what we do in terms of price wise and the way we plan the media I know we're the best we're the best in the country did I have any evidence no just said it gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] evidence why evidence they go why and I say oh because the way we do planning and the price point we work at I've been R in this industry a long time I've seen lots of people and I've also taken lots of big clients from other competitors and I know that we're the best bang just said it right there and if you say it so confidently they're not going to be like well no you're not they don't know they don't know anything about your industry how are they going to prove it they like oh okay well people love confidence they want to give their money to the best because they know the best is going to give them the best job it's better to be irrationally self-confident than not this also ties into the um and a thing did you notice how smooth I was right then when I said why I'm the best did I go um I think uh we're the best uh no I'm the best any job you do any client you're going to land you need to sit there and say I'm the best of what I do I'm the best at what I do what they going to do and say no you're not yeah I am no you're not how do you know it's my industry not yours I'm telling you I'm the best at what I do you're not going to find anyone better than me for this price point no way impossible I am the best there's no one else in the world who does what I do at this cost I'm the best congratulations you found the best you're lucky irrational self-confidence do not be a bullshitter but you need to be super self-confident smooth with it James Bond he walks in he's outnumbered everyone wants to kill him I'm the best doesn't matter I'm I'm me I'm a G it's how you have to be IR rational self-confidence super important a lots of people don't have enough confidence when they're trying to sell I don't know why you're trying to sell something and you're be all like oh well maybe [\\xa0__\\xa0] maybe irrational self-confidence now next point 45 we're on 45 we're almost halfway this is going to another thing that's going to change the way you view business and money I want you to understand something money cannot be made I I don't even like the saying making money we're making money nobody's making money the Federal Reserve makes money you're not the Federal Reserve if you are the Federal Reserve and you bought my course I'm very very humbled but I doubt it you're not the Federal Reserve you're an individual we're not the Roth's Childs we're [\\xa0__\\xa0] munchers which means we cannot make money all we can do is take money from other people money exists and we have to take it Dan the crackhead said to me something once when when our TV business was doing deals and there was money all around we had no profit but there was money in the bank and we had new cars and this big fancy office all this money I said how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] did this happen this is crazy I'm 20 I got this advertising he said money is like water and water is always moving so you have a ocean and the sun evaporates the water goes into a cloud and the cloud moves and then it rains and then it goes in a river and it goes to a pond and then it evaporates again from the Sun water never stays still the cycle of precipitation some geography for you and he said water money is like water it's always moving and if you stand in the right place at the right time you're going to get wet and that's absolutely true so money cannot be made it can only be taken from someone else you stand in the right place at the right time where money's moving you're going to take it 99% of people are middlemen most people are middlemen everyone's a middleman to some degree loads of companies exist out there that are just simply middlemen all they do is there's something this this is a product this person wants the product they're in the middle they make money they Supply the product done and it really ain't that complicated they're middlen so money cannot be made it can only be taken from other people to every single penny that comes in your bank is not made it's taken from someone else why are they going to give you their money why that's a serious question get a piece of paper and write down I have this I'm selling to this person they will give me their money because and you should be able to name a bunch of reasons and if you can't you have a problem don't be thinking about making money you're not making money you are taking money and because you are taking it you have to convince it from others that'll change the way you approach your marketing change the way you view Money change the way you approach your business because that's the reality of what's Happening you're not making [\\xa0__\\xa0] you're taking [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's very very different you're convincing it prying it from them precipitation cycle for bonus next don't make anyone Irreplaceable this is a very simple one but I've seen it happen time and time again you're a guy you're busy you get an assistant your assistant is exceptionally good your assistant knows all the passwords and [\\xa0__\\xa0] you don't know because you're busy and you're in a rush you know the end of the story don't make anyone Irreplaceable I wrote this down because I've seen two people lose their companies because they lost either their top salesman or an assistant so if your top salesman's floating your company he's Irreplaceable you need to fix that quickly so with T2 we had one salesman who was better all the rest his name was gerp who was really really good and we didn't make him Irreplaceable and when he left we really suffered what I should have done is go to gerp and say you know what bro you're really really good you're amazing do you mind on Fridays if every Friday morning you give a speech or you teach the guys the pitch or what you're saying on the phone and then you can have Friday afternoon off I'll give you a day off a week or I'll give you some extra money or we'll go out for lunch or I'll give you a company car anything if you can teach you don't mind you know in fact he probably would have done it for free because people like the ego thing the promotion of telling others what to do how about every Friday you can teach the guys and we can go through the script and they can learn from you to make the others get up to par so he's less Irreplaceable take what he knows never make anybody Irreplaceable if you see or identify someone as Irreplaceable or you look at your company and go I couldn't survive without this person then you're in trouble you should always have a company and you should work with people it should be fantastic but you should know if any of them leave you you can find someone else at all times next another basic sales tactic tell people they can't have things you already should know this if you've sold anything before but you should know tell people they can't have things all the time I tell people they can't have things you tell people they can't have things they want things this is the reality of the world so let's say someone calls you to buy let's say you sell flux capacitors I'm going to draw flux capacitor let's say you sell flux capacitors and someone calls up and goes I need two flux capacitors please the first thing you say to them is oh yeah sure okay no problem let me just check and make sure we have some because they been in high demand in the moment I think we might be sold out I'm not sure we have any what what do you need them for oh I actually want to buy them for XY Z okay I don't I don't think we have any right now let me get back to you what's your name number so what just happened in that exchange dude wants the flux capacitor I am in the middle in that short exchange I told him one he may not be able to have the flux capacitors and two I asked him why he needs the flux capacitors so one I told him he can't have it and two I asked him why he needs it to reconfirm in his mind that he needs it I don't know we have any maybe there's something else can I ask what you want to use it for oh I need it because my dick is too small and I want to use the flux capacitor to grow a man-sized penis that's fine I don't think we have any so he's reconfirmed his need and I've told him he can't have it takeaway his desire for the flux capacitor is higher now than it was before he wants it more than ever so this is obviously one example of how this can be done but you apply this basic principle get them to confirm what they need tell them they cannot have it you cannot have what you want you cannot have it you're not allowed it when I eventually call him back and go okay how many did you need two all right I can get a hold of two Fe you but it's going to be difficult are you looking to purchase right away oh well I'll s next week okay well I don't know if we're going to even have any then so by are you looking to purchase right away yeah I am if you ask someone are you looking to purchase right away and they say yes it's done Deal's done they ain't GNA [\\xa0__\\xa0] around giving you credit card details they've already said yes they're looking to purchase right away bang done this is sales you've managed to fulfill his need buy it now tell people they cannot have things now a lot of people do this online with the simple running out of time uh this book won't be allowed round forever blah blah but that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] because an ebook is around forever so everyone knows you're just doing it because it's garbage if you actually could use your brain think outside the box a little bit you could find a better way to do it than that telling people they can't have things so for example if you sold a $17 ebook on girls let's say saying the ebook won't be around forever everyone's like bro it's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] ebook it literally will last forever shut up if you say I'm going to cap the number of sales cuz I don't want people stealing my lines or I don't want my lines to become less effective that's probably a better angle it's not a fantastic angle but it's better at least it has some kind of validity to it telling people they can't have things is a fantastic way to make people want things it works so here's a little example of how that's done we're going to come back to this point later in another point I'm going to mention I nearly I nearly start talking about something but I've shut up because I know it's a later Point learning we have reached the halfway point of your education 50 and I've deliberately made this point 50 so I can tell you something that you already know about yourselves halfway through this presentation you already know what to do for your business you already know how to make money you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] lazy and I'll give you an example the other day I was talking to some chick story of my life she's talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] obviously about how she wants to run a makeup company I said if you want to run a Makeup Company why don't you have a makeup company she goes oh yeah I know but you know I don't know what to do I said okay I'll tell you exactly what to do here's what you do let me clean my board here's what you do go to alibaba.com get some samp of makeup find one you like put a new sticker on it make a website sell it on your website get YouTubers who talk about makeup to talk about your makeup brand sell makeup done you're in a makeup company she goes that's a good idea actually I go yeah it is a week later I said how much makeup you sold she goes what do you mean it's like I told you how to do an entire makeup brand from start to finish told you to do an entire company how much have you sold go oh well uh uh uh she did nothing seven days she did nothing I told her how to run a whole company you wanted to run a makeup brand I just told you how to do it didn't do it a lot of you are out there already sitting on ideas and guess why you're not doing them because you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] lazy you know how to do it but you won't do it you already know what you should do you already know how to do it but you're not doing it because you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] lazy you already have the idea go stop waiting number one speed is everything what are you waiting for for if you would have started the idea a week ago it' be ready by now you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] around a lot of people out there with business already know what to do they just are lazy and they don't get it done if you're waiting hoping you need some kind of investment or you're waiting for something you should have learned enough in the first half of this husters University that you don't need investment you can get the money coming in without investment we've already discussed that there's nothing to wait for I hear all the time man people don't realize how often they do it I hear people say oh I've got this idea for a course let's say cool a month later yeah I'm working on my idea a month do you have any idea what I could achieve in a month a [\\xa0__\\xa0] month if I have an idea it's ready same day I had this idea when did I have this idea for this we're halfway through filming we made the advert we made the website we start getting enrollment I had this idea 34 hours ago maybe like [\\xa0__\\xa0] let's get going you know what to do you're all slow and you're all lazy that's the reality that's 50 you need to accept that about yourself and accept that if you really had the tenacity that you desire if you really have the tenacity to get what you desire if you're really like me a go-getter a warrior you'd already be doing [\\xa0__\\xa0] too much waiting too much talking not on a [\\xa0__\\xa0] action I managed to get you here watching this program and I got paid to do so and I had this idea 32 hours ago when I was yelling at someone not to go to university I move quick that's why I'm rich and you're not missm makeup bimbo is what 99% of people are when it comes to business they have an idea and even if you tell them exactly how to do it they don't do anything they [\\xa0__\\xa0] sit around waiting for a makeup brand to fall out the sky and land on their face garbage 51 welcome to the second half of the husters University you should surely learned a lot so far I know what you're thinking Andrew you've already taught me too much Andrew you've already opened my eyes to a new way of thinking I never thought about business or money this way Andrew you've already taught me so much I already have had all the value I deserve for this course you should stop it right here I know I know but I'm [\\xa0__\\xa0] generous so you're going to do it again 50 more points 50 more lessons pay attention first 51 why are you running your business genuine question as a hustler why are you running your business I'm pausing so you can think about it if you don't know the answer I'll tell you the answer the answer is for money that's why you run your business people will come to you all the time and say start a business you're passionate about [\\xa0__\\xa0] you're only passionate about one thing cash it doesn't matter if you sell rocks doesn't matter if you sell jellyfish scrotums who gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] doesn't matter what you sell it matters that it sells sell what sells and get rich be passionate for profit most people come to me go I need to start a business I know about and I'm passionate about no you don't I could sell a makeup brand today I don't know anything about makeup but I know with my business Acumen the lessons I've already taught the way I'd start the company bringing money in before I put money out the way that I'd move quickly the way I know I'd make money I'd make money with a makeup brand fact fact and I don't know anything about makeup Warr in my life i't got [\\xa0__\\xa0] glue you don't need to know about things to sell things you need to know about selling to sell things the idea that you need to be passionate about the business to make money from it is complete Airy fairy [\\xa0__\\xa0] that idiots say you are passionate only about what's making you money you are passionate for profit you're not passionate about product so if you can make money selling concrete let me tell you something there's some Chinese billionaire out there b not m B who's selling rocks and concrete and making billions do you think he's passionate about concrete you think he's [\\xa0__\\xa0] making love to concrete kissing it late at night hugging it in bed think he's got a [\\xa0__\\xa0] concrete doll and he's made a little hole for his dick no he doesn't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about concrete he gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about money as should you drop that I need to be passionate garbage passionate for profit only 52 two this is specifically for you social media markers war is profitable but not always so I get this a lot I see a lot of people who have digital products constantly in battles with other people in the space trying to get attention through War to try and sell products War online is very much like real war and you need to sit and plan and strategize if it's worthwhile what are your end goals what are your end objectives how are you going to achieve them is your end goal and objective just to get people paying attention to your tweets is your end goal objective to sell products is your end goal and objective to defame and to devalue the the status of your opponent what is the end goal and objective War can be profitable but you need to make sure it is worthwhile you shouldn't be arguing with small accounts people who are smaller than you I will only beef with someone if they have more than 10,000 followers know your place know their place War can be profitable but you need a strategy for war so when I went to war with the Star Wars guys let's show the star warss tweets again my strategy was clear who likes Star Wars guys if you meet hotk girls she doesn't like Star Wars really they don't care who's passionate about Star Wars guys what kind of guys dorks what do dorks need well dorks usually have some money because they're dorks but they don't have any girls so if you will go through my Star Wars thread you will see my strategy is simple for war sell my PhD course sell the ability to get girls show lots of girls sell the ability to how to obtain females that was my strategy for that battle and it worked fantastically well that weekend I sold a lot of PhD course I think I did like 15,000 or something all basically off the fact that I said Star Wars was [\\xa0__\\xa0] I had a clear objective for my battle most people will go viral or they'll go battle and they haven't got a clear objective they don't know what they're trying to do I knew exactly what I was trying to do poke the Geeks annoy the Geeks annoy the Nerds and then and then off the back of it be humorous enough them to entertain the idea of learning from me how to get girls that made me money War needs strategy so if you're going to go to war and any way either in the physical world or the internet reality you need to be prepared and you're not prepared without strategy so war is only profitable if you have a strategy have a clear end goal have a clear objective don't end up like America Stuck in the Middle East in Forever endless pointless nothing wars that's what most people online are doing constantly jabbing at each other for no reason it's pathetic I don't go to to war often and if I go to war it's going to pay me I don't lose money to go to war war is profitable but only if you do it right keep that in mind 53 another thing that sells we already talked about predicting the future and preempting the future presume the sale by talking about the future do you know what else makes people buy things fomo fear of missing out I know you know this already you're thinking Tate I already know that how do you instill fomo well here's how most of you guys instill fomo if you don't buy now we're closing and you won't be able to buy no one cares because we know that that's a lie and we know that you're just closing it artificially to try and make some artificial deadline so no one cares how do I instill fomo I talk about how many other people have already bought it all these people over here know what I know you don't know [\\xa0__\\xa0] talk about other people buying your product and it will make people want to buy your product because they'll feel like they missed out so with television advertising I us to do this all the time constantly talk about other campaigns or other clients I had not in a braggy way just in a when I'm doing business with this or I did this campaign for this or this actually a very busy time of year for us right now we have 15 people sign up in the last two weeks we're really busy lots of people are doing this everyone's involved people are doing this people are doing this people are doing this oh I don't want to miss out if everyone else is doing it May everyone else thought it was a good idea why don't I think it's a good idea well I don't like this and that but but everyone else likes it so okay every even even successful people are herd mentality even very successful people are sheep if they think everyone else is doing it they're going to do it it's the same with fashion trends how many stupid [\\xa0__\\xa0] dumb pieces of clothing have you seen people wearing everyone else is wearing it people need to know that lots of other people are buying you need to make find a way to make that clear lots of people are buying buying lots of people are doing this you're the one who not doing it so with this University I told the truth I've been very very impressed with how many signups I've had I've not lied I didn't need to because I've had lots of signups but lots of people are learning all of my secrets to making money you don't know that person has fomo now I don't need to say I'm closing the uni I need to say look these [\\xa0__\\xa0] know a whole bunch of stuff you don't know I did this all the time with advertising it was fantastic with advertising this is a really busy time of year for us I used to say this you know what anytime of year January February March April May June July August September October November didn't matter do you know I used to say I say this is a really busy time of year for us because people are gearing up for Christmas they be like Christmas it's March I'll be like yeah exactly people are preparing already for the Christmas rush it's March so now they're sitting there going it's March we haven't even thought about Christmas yet all these other businesses are thinking about Christmas they're thinking about doing adverts at Christmas it's March we haven't even thought about Christmas yeah yeah oh y [\\xa0__\\xa0] oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] Christmas [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] I used to say that any time of year December 1st or January 1st I used to say January 1 I used to say when I used to go to meetings I say you know what's funny about January they say what I say we used to sign we sign up most of our Christmas advertising this month they go really go yeah yeah we're preparing for Christmas in January after Christmas everyone's made a lot of money with TV advertising people have made a lot of money in the campaigns we've already run so now they're already preparing for the next campaigns at Christmas so we're actually gearing up for Christmas right now people be sitting there going oh maybe I need to do a campaign at Christmas other people are doing things you're not doing anything you you are lazy you are slow other people are ahead of you quickly get on the train the Train's leaving quickly get on quickly pay the invoice yep thanks that's how you do it I us do it all the time with advertising talk about other people buying it sells always talk about other people buying super important because it sells because it one instills some confidence in them that you're a real person and a real company two it allows their thinking to be checked well I think it's a good idea and all these other people think it's a good idea so it must be a good idea so so on my website you'll notice on corporate.com I have something called social proof I pay money to have that thing in the bottom that tells people every time someone bu to my website so when you go on my website you see other people are learning you're not learning but other people are fomo super important you can apply this to nearly any other company any other business other people need to buy super important 54 chaos and opportunity I once got told that chaos and opportunity are the same word in Japanese I don't know if that's true but I'm going to say it chaos and opportunity are the same word in Japanese in other words every cloud has a silver lining every time stuff's [\\xa0__\\xa0] up every time there's chaos every time there's a mess there is an opportunity a huge opportunity and you have to find a way to identify it one way or another that's all it is there's always a way to identify so what's a chaos what's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] up I don't know off the top of my head it doesn't matter what it is the point is you already applied speed to fix it but you need to find a way to twist it in your favor there's always a way to twist it in your favor so it doesn't matter what it is let's say your back end isn't done properly your back end is missing a bunch of Vital Information let's say Okay cool so you need a whole bunch of orders you need something you need people to fill in some information to fill in the back end then you hit up all your customers with a ridiculous deal 99 Cents for our Face Screen usually $10.99 99 Cents if you buy with any other product some ridiculous [\\xa0__\\xa0] deal even if it's a break even what do you get you get a whole bunch of orders bills in your back end your back end's back even if you just broke even on it you filled in your back end you've got some more loyal customers who are more prepared and more used to spending money on your website bang done there's always an opportunity doesn't matter how [\\xa0__\\xa0] up things go wrong there's always an opportunity somewhere you just need to find it got sniff it out something's gone there must be some way here I can make some money and everything has to feed back to remember the money in that's important chaos and opportunity are the same thing especially that's chaos within your business if there's chaos within your Market it's even better so I don't know let's say okay I'll top my head 9911 why that came to my head I don't know 911 [\\xa0__\\xa0] up the airline industry all the planes got grounded no one could fly huge lines at the airports D chaos there's chaos within the industry so where's the opportunity this is all off the top of my head if I was an airline executive boss I'd be going okay from now on when we sell tickets we're going to sell it with an added option for insurance for refunds in the event of a terror attack or an unpredictable event we're going to contact a big insurance company we're to get them to insure us we don't have to really do anything we'll get them to insure us and will sell the insurance packages on top at premium and make some extra money cuz now people are who've been stuck in the airport for 4 days next time they book a flight they're going to be like yeah you know what I'm gonna pay for that insurance I remember last time it was a nightmare if I pay for this I get all my money back and they'll and they'll Bo me a hotel bang chaos in the industry opportunity to make more money this come to me off the top of my [\\xa0__\\xa0] head where else was there a huge chaos in an industry can you think of Chaos in an industry it happens now and again now and again things really go wrong so uh [\\xa0__\\xa0] knows but it happens all the time on smaller levels and when there's chaos within a specialized industry you need to find a way to monetize it like I just did there with 9911 the airlines because there's always a way to monetize chaos so when things go wrong it happens so like uh the Youtube apocalypse for example everything went super super wrong with uh all the YouTubers were making lows and low of money off advertising and then they ad apocalypse happen they weren't make money off advertising anymore so let's say that I'm a YouTuber and I see this has happen there's a huge chaos in the industry no one's making money off advertising anymore do you know what you do well I'd go okay well that means I need to sell merchandise so I'd contact all the other big YouTubers and say hey I've got a really good link for merchandise if you're interested in selling merch I start a [\\xa0__\\xa0] merch company or I get a link with a merch company for commission it's not complicated so let's look at the ad apocalypse everyone I don't know if you know what happened everyone had all these big YouTube channels they're making loads and loads and loads of money overnight that all goes down to zero now they still got viewerships but they got no money so how do they make money from there well they all decide to start selling merchandise but they don't have any merchandise set up or or worked out me as a big YouTuber I contact a merchandise company explain the ad apocalyps explain what happen explain I want to produce my own merchandise and explain that I know 10 other big YouTubers who are going to go to another merchandise company but I'm going to bring them to you if you'll give me a cut of how much money they bring you and they'll anyone in their right mind will go well okay get on the phone oh old school yeah I know 10 other YouTubers who I've met with and I work with blah blah blah they were going to use this merch website just Google another one and I'm saying that I want to use you but if I bring them all to you I want 5% of their turnover they agree bang now from the chaos in Industry you've become the [\\xa0__\\xa0] shark of merch now you're making money off all of their YouTube channels with one phone call by just being a g now every time jackass one and Jackass 2 sells a hat you get paid before you didn't get none of their money you just knew them now all you have to do is call them up and say bro ad apocalypse is [\\xa0__\\xa0] but I know a [\\xa0__\\xa0] awesome company that's going to sell us merch we're going to sell merch and make money bang chaos in the industry is an opportunity every time if you think like me if you think like a hustler this is setting up a company a revenue stream costs you nothing there's no outlay to this this is just a phone call and a Hustler's mindset bang you got paid chaos is opportunity find it every time 55 we're at 55 now you should have learned a whole bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] already but we got more coming 55 right remember what I said to you earlier that you cannot make money you can only take money this is super important this is lesson number 55 you have to learn to view all of your offers from your buyer's eyes you have to understand why that's so important the Federal Reserve can make money they can print money you can't there's only one way you're going to make money I'm going to give you a demonstration of how that happens this is Mr customer this is his money this is you he gives it to you beautiful very complicated I know that is how you make money you don't print money you don't generate money you make money because people decide to give it to you so you have to learn how to view your offer very very specifically from your buyer's eyes this is point number 55 so your offer is whatever I am the best M surgeon masseuse who the [\\xa0__\\xa0] knows blah blah blah you have to you're thinking of from your point of view oh I see this all the time with people oh but people are going to come do business with us because our oil is the best our massage oil is the best does he know anything about massage oil does he even give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] has he tried bad massage oil does he know the difference has he felt the difference between good and bad massage oil like like you think I see this all the time with people they think nitpicking tiny little details is going to make the money I took I took massage completely at random but let's use it as an example you have a massage company that's supposed to say massage you think oh we Ed the best massage oil that's why we're the most expensive and people are going to come to us if you actually instead of being a [\\xa0__\\xa0] dork like most people that run their businesses are you're a geek and you're a massage oil geek it doesn't matter if you're a programmer geek or a mechanic geek or whatever your business is a Drop Shipping geek anything it doesn't matter you'd understand that from the buyer perspective they don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about M massage oil they don't know the difference in different kinds of massage oil and they don't even know how they don't even know the benefit of using a good massage oil they've never used a bad massage oil they don't know how bad a bad massage oil is to them oil is oil so they're you're not viewing the proect things you're not viewing the offer from the eyes of the consumer you're viewing the offer from the eyes of you a knowledgeable nerd most consumers are not knowledgeable especially on what you're trying to sell them they don't know anything you have to view it from their eyes if you view it from their eyes You' understand they don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about massage oil so then your choices are as follows either you educate them on massage oil you incorporate that into your advertising and teach them and explain to them why it's better or you [\\xa0__\\xa0] it off and get something cheaper and save money those are the the two genuine options always look from your buyer's eyes why is your buyer going to give you money and do this interr like do it down to the the tiny details doesn't matter we'll go back to a coffee shop why are they going to come get coffee with me because my chairs are comfortable because my building looks warm I use those uh the same lights we have in here Edison bulbs to make it look warm my staff I've got a couple cute girls there my cups are are cool I got I got colored cups it doesn't matter you need to think of everything why would someone walk past my coffee shop and go yeah I actually do want coffee you have to think on a at that level for every single product you sell why you and not someone else because there's always someone else selling so you're viewing yourself from the buyer's eyes well you're doing that you can view your competition from the buyer's eyes so if you do it in this example this is the competition he uses cheap massage roil but he's cheaper than you so so from the buyer's eyes he's like okay massuse massuse he's 20 bucks cheaper massage is a massage I'll just go with him first they'll go with the cheap guy first and unless it's absolutely awful they're not likely to upgrade now I've said many times don't sell on price so I'm not saying you should try and out price your competition my point is if he is viewing two of you and the only difference he can identify is to cost why would he buy the most expensive one so you need to understand here okay I have an important job my job now it looks a dick see you're a dick you're a dick my job here is to identify my USP which is the expensive massage oil and educate my consumers as to why they should use it so every time someone calls you on any poster anything like that you need to be saying guaranteed no skin irritation or guarant or uh guaranteed best uh results for acne I don't [\\xa0__\\xa0] know best results for E eczema whatever anything to make people go oh why is that guaranteed what and you can explain to them oh we actually use this kind of oil other people use cheap oil from China we don't use that we use oil which is hand pressed by beautiful virgins in the Italian mountains blah blah blah blah view yourself from your buyer's eyes otherwise you're going up like this a dick and think about that seriously you can do this on so many levels it doesn't matter what product you have doesn't matter what you're selling view yourself from the buyer identify why they're going to do business with you above above someone else and never assume the buyer has knowledge this happens all the time where people go oh but actually my company does this and my company does that and I sit there and I go yeah but no one knows that and no one cares you think that matters it doesn't matter new thing that matters it doesn't matter at all you need to educate the buyer why that matters otherwise they don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] view yourself from the buyer's eyes do not view yourself from your own knowledgeable eyes and this feeds perfectly into lesson number 56 if you want an unbiased opinion from a general consumer on your company I'll tell you who you get it from number 56 Let Me Clear My Board quickly because having the dick behind me is a bit weird we've all identified your dicks number 56 ask your mother about your company doesn't matter what company you want to launch go and ask your mother about it I'll tell you why your mother is very is going to be very indicative of a typical consumer she isn't going to know a lot about what you're trying to do she isn't going to know a lot about technical stuff she isn't really going to understand a lot of the things you say I'm talking about my mother anyway my mother's an idiot and I mean that with all due respect because she's a nice lady but she's just stupid my dad was the smart one so they ain't going to know a whole bunch and two your mother's never going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] you so if you have an idea for a company let's say you want to [\\xa0__\\xa0] I don't know sell okay you're masseuse and you go to your mom hey I'm gonna open a Massage Company really you're going open a Massage Company why well I think I can make money making massages well how much is it going to cost this much that's that's expensive for a massage if that's the first thing she says you've got a problem no it's not expensive because we use the best massage oil what's the difference in massage oil it's all the same isn't it bang your mother is going to give you the best market research you've ever going to have in your life now if you're selling something super specialized and your mom may not understand then maybe I don't know a little bit more difficult but for anything basically normal you should ask your mom about your company because she's going to identify all of your problems straight away that conversation I just imaginary conversation I just have with my mom she identified that I'm coming across this expens and then no one gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about massage oil bang there's your problems identified your mom's never going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] you she's always going to be straight to the point and explain to you exactly what your issues are and what needs to be solved any company you're launching you need to show to and speak to your mom about because she's going to cut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] faster than anyone please remember your average typical consumer is not an educated person because most average people in the world are not educated people they don't have much knowledge of anything and they certainly don't have knowledge of your particular subject and they don't have specialist knowledge of your subject I don't know about you I mean I'm a professional fighter I've been getting massages where I've been training hard for many many years when I walk into a a massage part and they say do you want sports massage Swedish massage this massage that massage I don't I still don't know the difference I don't know they're all the same aren't they I don't know oh I just go oh okay this one so I don't even know about massages and I've probably had more massages than most people and this is my point exactly your consumer is not educated so Ed you need to educate them and and make them understand why you're charging more or you need to remove that barrier so when I just gave that conversation with the mom there with the massage oil she's already identified as expensive she's identified no one gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about massage oil your mom is going to tell you what ideas are good and what aren't and she's never ever going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] you but you know why because your mother wants you to be successful your mother does not want you wasting your time on some company that's never going to pay you your mother wants you to do well so any idea you have go to your mom and say do what do you think of this company see what she says and then if she sits there and she says only good things say well would you buy from me no because I don't want that why don't you want it I don't know I don't start writing down all the reasons she wouldn't buy from you why doesn't she want it why wouldn't she buy from you work out how to overcome all of these things you're going to get a whole bunch of information so you're speaking to your mom ask her have a general conversation about the company and then ask her why she would or wouldn't buy from you and make sure you write that information down she says I would buy from you because XY Z good those are your points you need to press home in all your advertising say she wouldn't buy from you because XYZ you need to go okay how do I solve how do I overcome these why wouldn't you buy a massage from me Mom I don't have time oh we have mobile masses though we come around we'll come to your house if you haven't got time oh yeah but you know uh well how do I book it we'll put a flyer for your door and you can just book by text message okay like anything to overcome find out what her problems are and overcome them so you have to speak to your mom by every single company this is super important because it's the best market research you're going to get if you can do your Market Research in advance before you launch launch your company that's less time you're going to spend [\\xa0__\\xa0] up more time you're going to spend making money so every single company I launch I speak to my mom about it so even when I launched my PhD course I said to my mom I'm gonna launch a course telling guys how to get girls and she said oh don't make more men like you out there that's what she said I was like what do you mean like me she goes oh the way you are with women and I sat there and I thought okay bang I know this is going to work because even my mom knows I'm BOS even my mom though she seen so many chicks coming out the door even my mom's like all right I don't know what kind of son I've raised but he's he's tearing through these chicks dangerously so with the PHD course I knew it would be a fantastic idea because even my mom was saying to me look you're going to make some dangerous men out there so every single business I've ever run by my mom all of them and sometimes she said some pretty smart [\\xa0__\\xa0] there's a level you know what there is there is a level of intelligence which comes from absolute stupidity so like smart and stupid is a circle so you have Smart at the top and you have stupid at the bottom and you have this circle let's say this is the Smart side and this is the stupid side so it's in half this is stupid I know this is written bad this is smart but sometimes you can get comments with just which are just on the edge you know and moms are great at this so like I like I I bought my new Lamborghini and I drove to my mom's house I said Mom I bought a new car what do you think she goes what is it I say Lamborghini she goes how much was it I said I was 300 Grand she goes three you spent 300 Grand on a car I like yeah she goes let me see so she comes out and she says something that was so smart it was actually you know so stupid it it circled back around to smart she looked at my Lamborghini he goes why would you spend 300,000 on something only has two seats as in it should have more seats because it cost more money so I should have got a bus for my money I guess that's her logic her logic is why would you it's only got two seats so it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] which is stupid but it kind of gets into the smart realm it's kind of you know you get a lot of these kind of comments from mothers they say things which are kind of dumb but kind of smart and if you can extract those comments and apply them to your company you'll fix a lot of problems in advance so that's why speaking to your so important next key Point 57 and this is very very important I'm GNA tell you a story with this one money will never motivate your staff never I'll tell you why money is numbers and Numbers Never End which means if you're going to try to motivate people with money it's going to get hard if someone doesn't like the job and doesn't like you and doesn't like anything about how they're treated in the job or how they feel or what they do you have to pay them a lot of money to make them do it a lot of money and that is not very very cost effective if somebody enjoys what they do and they feel part of a community and they like it then you don't have to pay much at all and the proof I'll give of that I just fat my cof just saying proof my my coffee everywhere is that people do [\\xa0__\\xa0] for sense of community all the time remember after T2 television I started vixel my own company to sell television advertising so what happened is I found an office in Luton that was 400 a month and I decided I was going to become a million television advertising so I found out got 400 pound office me and Tristan would uh sit there and then we advertised for salesman commission only so it was a commission only position you sent emails all day long just emailing marketing managers all day all day just copy and pasting just emailing anyone you could find on the internet emailing all day long if they replied to you there'd be a phone call I'd do the phone call so T2 was all phone pitching and that's why it took a long time for us to train our staff every single day we were doing two hours of training phone pitching about television advertising phone pitching phone pitching phone pitching and T2 made money but training people to be good on the phones is hard and a lot of people are scared to do code calls well and people are lazy with code calls so me had the idea you know what we're going to email blast anyone we can find we'll buy all the magazines email every marketing manager we'll go through all of the websites we can find we'd Google up things like store locator if you type store locator into Google you have all the companies have a store locator these are companies with multiple branches so television advertising will suit them because it's they're across their National they're National email email email if any any market manager email back I do the call because I'm trained on the phone so vixel was different T2 everyone pitched on their own vixel is just emails out so we we put adverts out there for a position which was commission only so no basic every deal you landed you got 5% so if you landed a 20 grand deal on T TV you'd get a th000 pounds so if you landed two a month You' get two grand a month ain't gonna make you rich but whatever and we were hiring basically anyone like dorks it doesn't matter like we had one guy who had a criminal record we had one dude who's just a bit of a weirdo some fat guy with some other guy who definitely drunk too much cuz stunk a boo but who cares they're coming in they're sending the emails if someone emailed back I'd call them over time as people came and quit and didn't land any deals we ended up with quite a good little team of four guys plus me and Tristan so six guys who were in this office now these guys were working hard they were emailing like machines because you can't get a machine to email because you got to go to the websites find their email marketing manager's name you can buy email marketing manager lists but they never worked because it changes so often this [\\xa0__\\xa0] so we had to go and manually find and manually type it in so these guys are emailing emailing email email emailing anyway most of the guys I had there for the first solid month didn't make a [\\xa0__\\xa0] penny I had free staff for a month I had four I had four guys supposed to be interested in and they're working their asses off for free how did I motivate them every day I'd come in positive energy come in full of energy guys today's the day we're g to make it oh the your guy emailed back I'm calling him later that's a deal that's definitely a deal I've doing this a long time might take a few weeks that's going to be a deal and I'd order pizza every day I'd order pizza we'd sit around we'd eat our pizza in the office I'd talk about the Big Dreams of how T2 was such a big company how vixel was going to be bigger I'd sell a dream and they'd eat pizza and everything was fine so for a $10 pizza every day I had four members of full-time staff now none of these men were motivated by money they were motivated by my energy the dreams of the future they weren't getting paid anything they may have been motivated by the future Prospect of money but I hadn't offered them any money to turn up and they were on time every single day you do not need money to motivate your staff if your staff respect you and they know where you're going and things are going going to go well then you don't need money to motivate them I actually [\\xa0__\\xa0] up big here because what happened with this company is I accepted a fight and I decided to go training in Slovakia and when I went away Tristan came with me we went away for 10 days and in the 10 days me and Tristan didn't turn up in the office all the men quit every single one and that's was the end of vixel whole business fell apart and that's because we weren't there the leaders had abandoned ship they felt there's no leadership energy in the office there's no one buying Pizza why am I coming here every day for free all of a sudden it Dawns on them and they leave but the point I'm trying to make with the story is number 57 is that money will never motivate your staff there's better ways to motivate your staff obviously pay your staff well obviously if they need money give them money I'm not saying you can get multi work for free my point is I see loads of people who go I'll start a company and I'm going to pay my guys the most and I saw this with a fight promotion so there's a fight promotion that come along goes I'm going to launch the biggest fight promotion uh some guys I know with money big money as well we want to launch a kick they came to me we want to launch a kickboxing promotion want to be the biggest how you going be the biggest we're going to pay all the fighters the biggest money the most money so they all want to fight for us get the best fighters sounds like a good idea especially Fighters because most Fighters are broke the problem is they didn't end up getting the best fighters because they didn't have good exposure they didn't have good cameras they didn't uh have good social media platforms so a lot of the were choosing to fight other places because of the prestige they got for winning as opposed to this organization's nor heard of and a couple extra hundred money doesn't motivate there's far better ways to motivate them money in life so don't be thinking you need to pay your staff loads of money to make them loyal to you that's complete [\\xa0__\\xa0] at all that's not true at all get that out your head money doesn't motivate 58 success is exponential when you've done something once it's much quicker to do it again it's the same with anything you'll say you start driving you parallel park once it takes forever eventually you get good at parallel parking it's quick it's exactly the same with success success exponential as you've done things it becomes quicker to do things it takes a long time to make a million it's easier to make a second million it's even easier to make a third it's easier to make a fourth because you understand mechanisms so starting from the very very bottom if you can stay motivated and work hard when you have nothing you're in the hardest part it does get easier the problems change as you get bigger and become a bigger company you have new kinds of problems you may have legal problems or fulfillment issues or all these other problems but you won't be broke anymore at least I believe business gets easier it's starts hard H for hard and gets easier if you can stick it out here you'll enjoy this most people quit here 99% of people quit when it's hard and that's why the 1% is the 1% it's exponential first time you make a website you have to go out there you have to Source all these different companies or you have to find a member of staff to make it and you make it and you make mistakes and you change it cu the SEO ain't set up blah blah whatever the third fourth fifth sixth seventh time you make a website you can do it very very quickly and you can do it properly the first time without mistakes so success is exponential keep that in mind that anything that's seems to be like taking forever now remember lesson one speed speed speed speed speed but you're going to get better at it you're going to get faster at it and soon things are going to blow up quickly I launch companies every day I can launch a company I can launch a new company a day I've got to that point now I know my people my staff are good I can say James do this Dylan do this Luke do this Tristan do this you do this you do that you do this I'll do this bang and within six hours everything's done I'm at that point now but that's come from so much success previously it's exponential it builds up just keep that in mind now 59 this is a really important lesson super important and I'm assuming this is going to apply to some of you who are watching this 59 nobody is broke let me get rid of this nobody is broke they're simply just buying other stuff they're buying other things people go I can't afford it that means well I can afford it but I decided I need something else more broke people are not broke they just want something else more than they want your offer your offer has to be more important than food so what you offer whatever it is what did we selling flux capacitors how did I draw a flux capacitor was like this wasn't it food no matter what it is has to be more important than food because when broke people say they can't afford it unless they're literally crackheads on the street which is quite rare they're still buying food and they're probably still buying paying for their car paying for their rent they're going out at the weekend with their friends they're still socializing they're still paying for that ski trip next month so they're paying for plenty of stuff they're just not playing for what you've got so no one's broke they just decide that other things are more important than what you offer so how do you get around that well you have to make sure your offer is always geared as more important so let me ask you some of you guys who bought husters University it wasn't too big a deal for you you're sitting on some money you got some savings or you're in my Forex program you're already making lots of money with Forex and you thought [\\xa0__\\xa0] it all right I'll buy University some of you guys who bought this literally it was all your money but you thought I need this I don't need to go out and Club I don't need to I need husters University instead so I convinced you and you made the right decision I didn't convince you in a negative way I convinced you in the correct way because you made a very smart decision I convinced you that my knowledge and this course is more important than going to the club or in an expensive restaurant or some dumb [\\xa0__\\xa0] I convinced you of that so nobody is broke they're just buying other things get out of your head the idea that people can't afford things they can't afford it they just don't want it enough because if they wanted it they' buy it because they're buying a whole bunch of other [\\xa0__\\xa0] everyone is everyone is spending money every day they're buying other things so how do you convince people your offer is worth more than something as basic as food well that's very very simple you just promise it's going to lead to more food later done so and that's the truth with University so why is hust University worth more than anything else you could do because if you listen to the advice in here and start your own business you can do that [\\xa0__\\xa0] later more it's exactly the point so let's say you sell flux capacitors and you say to somebody buy one can't afford it yeah you can no I can't I can't I got pay my rent blah blah blah blah say well if you buy a flux capacitor your rent's going to reduce so in the long run you're not going to pay as much rent for example or if you buy a flux capacitor you're going to have more food or you're going to make more money so you can buy more food or you're going to have your own Farm who gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] what find a way to get round people's objections so that they understand that buying your product is more important than doing any of the other dumb [\\xa0__\\xa0] they do nobody is poor everybody's a customer and everybody has some money everybody you have to get round it so let's say you're selling [\\xa0__\\xa0] it I don't know there's a dude in the war room right now who's just launched his own company he's selling uh a gas and oil supplies I don't know anything about gas and oil supplies I also don't know how he sells I don't know his particular selling tactic however I'm sure he makes it very very clear to people when he tries to sell them a new pipe you need this new pipe that's my drawing of a pipe it's a square it's beautiful you need this new pipe I can't afford it but if you buy this new pipe you're going to save money you can't afford to not have it because you're going to save money if you buy it so if your problem is money then you really need this pipe bang flipped on them your problem's money well you told me you have no money well now you need to pipe otherwise you're going to never have money money now the pipe is more important than saving money go buy the pipe you have to make everyone understand that your offer is more important than anything else they can possibly buy if they put something else above it more important like food air water promise them more food air and water if they buy your product nobody is broke they just need to want it and you have to make People Want it That is your goal so get out your idea oh right now I hear all the time from business owners oh it's a slow period right now why oh the recession or people ain't got much money right now complete garbage complete [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know what I ran cam girls in the height of the recession when all these businesses were going out of business because of the recession there was dudes sending me millions of dollars while jerking off you know why because they really wanted to see some titties while they druged off they wanted it they wanted titties more than they wanted anything else so why are some businesses Recession Proof why you think during a recession things like gambling things like smoking drinking cam girls you think vices would disappear oh it's a recession we have to cut back all the dumb [\\xa0__\\xa0] and focus on the Necessities why does that not happen why does the dumb [\\xa0__\\xa0] grow because people go oh okay it's a recession I'm going to save my money and they start being tight and being stupid about other things but they still can't control their vices and they end up blowing more money on their vices because with vices people want it and this proves my point absolutely even during the international recession people are not broke you just have to make them want what you have get that out your head that people are broke it's completely untrue you just have to make your offer more appealing than anything else to compulsively spend their money on and they'll buy your offer and you do that by either promising more of something else or positioning yourself above something else very very easy next nothing ever fixed itself 60 let me wipe my board quickly 60 nothing ever fixes itself this is the same with anything inside of any company and we're all adults and we should know this so you're an adult when's the last time your car broke down and you did nothing about it and it fixed itself when the last time you had a flat tire and instead of going to the mechanic you came out a few months later and the tire was fixed never nothing fixes itself if you have a problem inside of your company or a problem making money you better do something about it quickly I see people come along and go oh yeah it's been a few slow couple of months I'm like okay so what have you been doing oh you know well it's been a slow couple months we're going to place some more adverse wait it's been months of slow and now you're thinking of placing adverts after the second slow day I would have been in a panic like whoa what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] going on it's been two days where's the [\\xa0__\\xa0] money oh but sometimes it can vary from day to day nah don't buy it change something now speed you nothing is ever going to fix itself in any in any company same with all your Tech stuff PayPal or [\\xa0__\\xa0] your your hosting I I know like I get one guy I worked with James he called he thinks I'm super impatient if you wait around for other people to just fix things it never happens I've had it a million times the number of times I've been waiting on PayPal thinking oh yeah it's G to be fine it just never happens you have to Hound everyone to the end of the Earth I've been in business a very very long time and I cannot think of a single example where I thought H I'm not going to chase or Hound or annoy this person and it's going to work out fine it's never happened you have to be constantly on the phone six times a day you have to be beefing people Non-Stop and there's aason reason for that is because the people who work at these companies or the people who work for someone else they don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about you they've got their own problems their girlfriend's cheating on them they can't afford their rent they hate their job you think he's really thinking oh I really better get this online this this hosting online for that guy no they don't [\\xa0__\\xa0] care even if you call them they're like yeah I understand sir it's a big problem they don't care they don't care they' got their own lives they don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] no one gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about you so nothing's ever going to fix itself so don't be afraid to be a hard ass with the technical things that's the first thing and second thing if you got a problem inside of your business and you you've identified it you need to start thinking of a battle plan to fix it quickly it's not going to go away without you doing something just like the flat tire one if you have a lack of customers sitting there going okay well we're still building the brand still building the name so let's see where we stand in a month no you've identified you have a lack of customers what can you do about it now lesson one speed how can you fix that problem today even if you come up with a plan and you if you follow my other rules that you've learned so far you can come up with a plan that cost no money effectively you come up with a plan and you implement it even if it doesn't work you're still in the same position what's the worst that can happen so this is where Tristan and I sometimes have a little uh disagreement so let's say Tristan and I when we were running the cam girls uh there'd be like three or four days which are really slow and I'd say to Tristan where the [\\xa0__\\xa0] the money he go oh it happens there's a big football game guys are busy blah blah blah so no I don't buy that nah this girl needs a new account because her account score is low this girl needs new cost this girl needs this D we got to change everything and trist's like it's been three days just chill I'm like n change everything we need this we need that her set has been the same for a year let's re let's re-wallpaper that wall give her a different set let's change this let's change this St so we'll do all those changes then two weeks later money's rolling in trist will go well money's rolling in now but I don't know if it was we don't know if it was the changes you made or it was just the football game the CH the money might have rolled in anyway and we've gone through all that and we don't know why I said look what I know is this the money is now rolling in Butterfly Effect I know that in the current reality I did a bunch of things and now the money's appeared you're saying that maybe if we didn't do those things maybe the money would have come anyway well I don't live in a maybe World nobody knows that I know that there's two days two three slow days I identified a problem I took drastic action and I fixed it now it's fixed you can try and pretend I didn't fix it and that it was going to happen anyway if you want but things don't fix themselves I know how the world works and Tristan eventually will concede so if things are slow for one or two days I'll get in panic mode with my business and I'll [\\xa0__\\xa0] start doing something and that's when you have your best ideas when you're in panic mode and as long as you can Implement those ideas without spending a whole ton of money good I'm not saying Panic buy Google ads and blow a million I'm saying sit there and go okay how can I get customers in right here right now speed what can I do without spending money all I did was buy some wallpaper adjust some beds make a new account that's free tell the girl to change her lipsticks and bought our $10 costume I spent 20 bucks boom done all the money started rolling in and I know it's because of me Tristan's going to Tristan sometimes would be like oh well maybe it would have happened anyway nah maybe maybe you live in a maybe world I live in the real world I did a whole bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] all the girls are busy now I could have just sat there three days are quiet four days are quiet one week is quiet two weeks is quiet yeah it's a quiet period yeah people aren't it's so it's hot outside people don't want to sit on their computer yeah and made excuses like a [\\xa0__\\xa0] or I could have done things action speech number one fixed the problem and made some [\\xa0__\\xa0] money that's the difference between me and even Tristan who I've mentored on business because Tristan will be more like oh it'll be fine it'll be fine it will never be fine unless you fix it it's never going to be okay unless you do something the customers are never going to come unless you bring them they're never going to give you money unless you force them your website's never going to fix itself [\\xa0__\\xa0] PayPal is never going to email you and go okay we're working now your payment processor is never going to go oh okay we'll update you next week and everything's going to be fine no nothing is ever going to be okay unless you take it into your own hands and fix it yourself and any adult who's lived any kind of Life knows that's true when you leave things to other people it doesn't get done you know that you already know that so keep it in mind especially your business two three days of no customers do something nothing fixes itself that's super important 61 never ever ever ever say no to money ever 61 I can't believe I have to tell people this but sometimes I do never say no to money so my business card will insert the video here people ask me all the time about my business card and they take it off me and go is this a joke me joke [\\xa0__\\xa0] I ain't [\\xa0__\\xa0] joking it's not a joke I hand this out in multi-million dollar business deals this isn't a [\\xa0__\\xa0] joke this is my business card take Enterprises unlimited because there's no limits to what I can do what look a limit company or we were limited there's certain things there's nothing I can't [\\xa0__\\xa0] do it's the whole point of the card kickboxing world champion also a millionaire an all round nice guy now most people probably know those facts but I thought might as well put them on the card anyway now when you flip the card to the back there's a whole list of activities I can complete for a fee and this is why people get the idea the insinuation I'm joking the difficult done immediately The Impossible takes a little longer Miracles by appointment War's fault that's right Wars fault you don't need to be hiring no Army you have you not seen Rambo only takes one dude who's pissed off you can hire me if you want to go to war hire me I'll get it done assassinations plotted Revolution started uprisings quelled I can qu I can start a revolution or I can quell an uprising either way you want it done I can do both dragon slaying Dragon comes along called Big Daddy tape jet charter ventriloquist sexual athlete the list goes on and on but the basis behind this card the reason this card is important it isn't a joke it's what I'm basically saying is if you're prepared to pay me I'm prepared to get it done that's my basic business philosophy even if I don't know how to do it that's not the problem the problem is how much you're going to pay me someone comes along and goes Andrew I need you to build an oil rig in the most dangerous rough Seas where Oil Rigs can't be bill and I make up my price I send them an invoice for $6.6 billion if they pay my invoice I'll find a way to get it done maybe I have to hire someone else maybe I have to Outsource it whatever but if you're prepared to pay me there's no job I will not take if you're prepared to take to pay the fee there's a dragon and no one can beat it and it's it's killing it's destroying the whole city Godzilla's here wire me the money I'll get it done it's my basic business philosophy so I put some examples here which may seem a little bit extreme to you losers but they're not extreme because they're proving a point I dictate my prices if you pay the invoice regardless of what needs doing I'm the man for the job I'm currently building an army I'm building an Army in my War Room my war room is a dedicated group of like-minded individuals who are out here looking to get paid looking to raise funds looking to change their entire worldview I've said in my other videos how important it is to only sit and talk about money well in the war room all we do is sit and talk about money and a few other things but mainly money besides the explicit pictures but war room will be soon added to my new business cards which are coming I'm going to have some new ones made and they're going to be embossed with real gold worth about six or seven do each card give them M to girls in the club throw my money away you know how it is but the war room is the real deal so if you're thinking you want a c as awesome as mine don't worry about that the first you to do is get in the War Room get some soldiers meet some like-minded individuals and then you can worry about trying to be a g like big daddy T so you'll see the lesson of my business card is very very simple my business card is basically I'll do anything if you pay me you want me to tame crocodiles you want me to overthrow a government you want me to [\\xa0__\\xa0] lead a rebellion in a nation you want me to become a pirate I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] how much are you paying me 2.2 Bill okay here's the bank details you send me billions of dollars I'll get it done I don't care if I have to Outsource it to someone else I don't care if I have to [\\xa0__\\xa0] I don't know what I'll do if you want a rocket on the moon and you're going to pay me billions of dollars I will find a way to put rocket on the moon pay me my price my price may be too much I may be overpriced but if you decide to pay me and I have to go speak to Elon afterwards at some Billionaire's party and say bro I need to rock on the moon here's five bill but you paid me six bill I'll get it done and this is the point never say no to money I see companies all the time saying no to money you don't realize even you say no to money oh we don't take Bitcoin why oh oh oh we don't like it it's still money it's still some money you may not like it you may not you may prefer other forms of currency but it's still money there's someone out there who wants to pay in Bitcoin you need to create a golden bridge for people to pay you money it has to be very very easy to give you money so if you want to buy any my services you can buy in any currency in the world you can buy in Bitcoin if you don't want to buy through the website you can send me a direct bank transfer if you don't want if you want to come meet me in person and give me cash I've done this for war room members hey I'm in Romania next week can I give you cash no problem we'll meet up and have a coffee I will take your money any way you want to send it if you want to give me Iraqi dinars fine let me check the exchange rate Bang Yeah 18 million Iraqi dinars please if you want to give me Iraqi dinars you want to give me gold bars if you want to give me [\\xa0__\\xa0] laundry detergent I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] if you have two trucks of laundry detergent worth $5,000 and you want to use that as payment I'll take it I may try and say don't you have cash no I don't have cash you go Bitcoin no I don't go Bitcoin all I have is this detergent cool bro I'll take it I will take your money never say no to money any way people want to give it to you take it any way it's easiest for them take it this comes down to the whole legality thing remember what I said earlier get rich before you get legal this is important I know loads of guys who are like oh we can't take cash because it's against the rules we can't take Bitcoin cuz the federal Reser the tax you're not rich yet bro you're not a multi-millionaire you need to take everything you can [\\xa0__\\xa0] get worry about that [\\xa0__\\xa0] later [\\xa0__\\xa0] the rules dude wants to give you laundry detergent and a gold bar and [\\xa0__\\xa0] a pile of South Korean wan who gives this [\\xa0__\\xa0] he's paying take it take the money always take the money anyway they're prepared to pay any way they're prepared to pay such a [\\xa0__\\xa0] mistake people make make it very very easy for people to pay you because people going to have loads and loads of unique ways of paying so this happens a lot in Romania so in Romania when a company sponsors another company they usually do it with stock so let's look at my my good friend Sebastian anyone knows me knows my good friend Sebastian he owns rxf rxf is a cage fighting organization so here's our cage on the cage you have the sponsors which get to be all over TV but the sponsors don't give him cash they give him product so one of the sponsors sells roof Roofing things but they don't want to give Sebastian cash because this is Romania and it's just Romania Works in a different way so he goes I don't want to give give you cash I'll give you roof tiles so he's paying for his sponsorship in roof tiles Sebastian goes okay cool I'll take your roof tiles takes roof tiles then he has another boy he has who goes out and sells the roof tiles or he makes some phone calls about a bunch of roof tiles who wants roof tiles old school for musen but effectively Sebastian doesn't go no I want money because then the sponsor will go well I don't want to give you money I've got a bunch of roof tiles on likeo and then he'll lose a sponsor Sebastian makes it very very easy to do to do business with him if you'll pay me in roof tiles Lumber [\\xa0__\\xa0] anything you want to give me no problem just give it to me and all you need from there is one or two other connects to shift the stuff because roof tiles are money because roof tiles are worth money he gets $5,000 worth of roof tiles he calls a guy hey I got $5,000 of roof tiles take them for four and a half Grand come pick them up right now bang he may lose 500 bucks bang bang bang bang transaction done doesn't lose a sponsor make it very very easy for people to pay you and never never never say no to money ever 62 this is some basic [\\xa0__\\xa0] you should already know you need to diversify to become antifragile against attacks and when I say this I'm talking particularly about big Tech and also the way you accept money so the the reason I put these in the order I have is because they all lead into each other so if you're like Sebastian you're anti fragile you're very antifragile because the way he takes money makes him very very hard to stop so let's say the IRS or the tax services were to come along and freeze Sebastian's bank account he'll still run his shows because he just take roof tiles roof tiles and lumber and alcohol he doesn't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] he runs a show and by the end of it he's sitting on [\\xa0__\\xa0] 400 bottles of vodka enough roof tiles and lumber to build three mediumsized homes he's fine because this is how Romanians are they Wheeler Dealers they're hustlers this is the hustlers University it's about hustling you want to give me a whole bunch of wood and some bottles of [\\xa0__\\xa0] wine cool give me it Sebastian's anti fragile now you can block his bank doesn't make a difference can't stop that man he's running shows he's getting wood doesn't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] be antifragile so the more ways you take money the more anti fragile you are because a bank may freeze your account or you might lose a particular merchant account so you need to have lots of different Merchant accounts Bitcoin lots of different ways to take money you need lots of different banks but also you need to be antifragile in places you advertise you need to be on all the platforms even the ones that aren't s super so successful because the successful ones will get banned I am on Twitter Facebook YouTube with two channels telegram you've got to be everywhere all the time not even if it's just to reach new people even if it's to reach the same people different ways because [\\xa0__\\xa0] gets [\\xa0__\\xa0] destroyed you have to be antifragile the easiest way to be antifragile is to diversify I talk about this in one of my tape speech videos which we're going to reference in here about you can't go off grids you need to be on as many grids as e e yourself on as many grids as possible I've said to some of my friends who have like five grand in the bank go go five grand in the bank I want to spend on a holiday I say no if you're going to spend five grand on a holiday [\\xa0__\\xa0] that going to come out with nothing you just spend that 5 grand going to another country going into the local d LA or the department of driving or whatever it is and find out what it takes to get a driver's license I say this to people and people call me crazy but I think it's far more crazy that people don't do this we live in a world now where if you're American you can fly to England or if you're England you can fly to America you can go into the office that issue driver's licenses you can say what do I need to get driver's license I've just moved to the country they can say you need proof of residence you need a bank account you need XY Z and you can spend a couple weeks going through the [\\xa0__\\xa0] process getting what you need doing a driving test and passing a driving test and having a license in the foreign country when I say people do this they go why what do you mean why if you have one driver's license then that country can take your license at a win and restrict you from moving and making money for going 10 m hour over the speed limit people call me crazy when I say I have seven driver's licenses I have seven licenses from seven countries and each year I take two weeks out of my year to go to a country Park up if I have to get rental agreement I get rental agreement if I need to get bank account I get a bank account anything it takes takes to and go through the motions sometimes I haven't even got to do a test sometimes if I prove I have another license they just give me a license anything it takes to have a license so that when I am stopped by the police for speeding which is all the [\\xa0__\\xa0] time CU I have Lamborghini Asar and a Bentley I drive how I [\\xa0__\\xa0] want I'm not going to live like a little cuck it's 50 m hour if I do 55 miles an hour they're going to take it away from me this is how people live under government control suppressed and Afraid don't don't lose my license if you stop me in America I'll pull out a Polish license what are you going to do call Poland what's the [\\xa0__\\xa0] officer going to do you were speeding yeah sorry I have to give you a ticket problem we should take your license you have to deal with Poland about that I don't even know how the process works if you try to take a Polish license I don't think the American cops even have a jurisdiction over a Polish license I always say I don't think but I do know that they don't people an American cop cannot take the license of another Nation they can't do anything every country I'm in I just pull out different licenses I get sto for speeding five times a week no one does [\\xa0__\\xa0] CU I have so many dver licenses and you guys should do the same thing and the point of this story is the first thing you do to get money is you need to prevent a single government having access or control over your entire life same thing with passports man if I [\\xa0__\\xa0] up big time and England wants me in jail I could fly a Nigerian passport or an American or an English or a Polish or an Estonian I have so many [\\xa0__\\xa0] passports you going to block them all I I've got four more I haven't even named on YouTube they can't stop me traveling there's always a passport I can pull out there's always a driver's license I can pull out if you ban one I've got another one I've got bank accounts in 19 countries my [\\xa0__\\xa0] is Diversified so am I off grid no I'm on so many [\\xa0__\\xa0] grids you can't lock the Grid on me because there's too [\\xa0__\\xa0] many of them people are asking me what's the first thing I should do when I get money I'll tell you the first thing you should do right now you a little bit money in the bank is look it up because you'll be surprised even a license like a tie license TI is the best you pull out a tie driver's license it's not even in English it's in those squiggly letters and they're like is this real like yeah it's real you can't drive here on this yeah you can Google it if I have an international driver's permit which I have which cost 150 bucks and a tie license I can drive in Europe and they sit there and they look at the tie license and think what am I going to do call Bangkok I [\\xa0__\\xa0] it and they let you go so people say what's the first thing you should do you get money the first thing you should do when you get money is at least obtain two passports at least obtain as a minimum two driver's licenses and at least as a minimum at bank accounts in two differentes otherwise what otherwise you're living like a little cuck at the wh of one government let me tell you something governments are [\\xa0__\\xa0] governments also change I find it absurd you [\\xa0__\\xa0] right now all of you watching this right now are driving to and from work you need a car for your livelihood you need a car to pay your mortgage and you're living in a world where if you go 10 m hour with a speed limit they're going to take that away from you and you've done absolutely nothing to negate that people call me crazy Having Eight licenses I think having one license is [\\xa0__\\xa0] crazy get it done and the basic lesson behind this is very simple you need to be able to take money so many different ways into so many different bank here remember where I said earlier this is your business you're taking money so many different ways into so many different places you're advertising yourself in so many different places that you're near impossible to stop this is how you need to think about anti frigidity and this is another reason why the whole idea of being super legal with your company oh I've got my limited company it's all set up here's my limited company and here we are blah blah and and and we fill file our taxes that they can come long close you down like that you should have eight limited companies and eight different bank accounts and nine different payment processors you're a hustler Hustlers can take money even if you're all do even if it's just one company even even if you're still fulfilling it from the same warehouse even if you're doing one thing find a way so that you're very very difficult to pin down like who is this guy we froze two of his Banks he's still driving a Lambo how this is a lesson from my personal life I'm telling you antifragility comes from diversification so you can get one [\\xa0__\\xa0] member of staff and make their job okay we already have one payment processor stripe said yes to us let's say I want to be on every other payment processor sign us up for them all get them all approved put them all on on on websites exact clones of our current website on domains that we don't make active yet be ready to roll this ties into the lesson before it debt in many cases isn't real now it depends on the business you run because this is subjective but I'll tell you a story I knew a Jewish guy who sold everything he basically he he basically was doing an Alibaba business getting [\\xa0__\\xa0] like wind up flashlights and crap way this was during T2 so what 15 years ago before Alibaba was a website before everyone understood what Drop Shipping was before Amazon he'd go to these trade shows in China buy wind up torches and get them into stores in England Superstores and sell them on his website whatever it was making big money now this Jewish guy wouldn't pay an invoice until you threaten to take him to court so you'd invoice him for something anything he'd ignore you you'd invoice him again you ignore you final warning ignore he you'd have to you'd have to invoice him for four months and eventually you said okay we're going to court with this invoice then he'd pay because he could always find a new supplier so the supplier got fresh after that he just found someone else but his attitude was very much like debt isn't real as long as I don't have to pay money out of my bank my business will always always be successful even if I'm operating at super low margin so the a lot of people are concern oh debts oh D look debts ain't real for a few reasons one it takes a long time for someone to collect debt against you that's the first thing two if you never want to do business with that person or that company again there's no point in [\\xa0__\\xa0] even paying them at all three once people get desperate for their money you can often do deals on debt so if a if it goes to a debt collection company or you owe someone 10 grand and you call them up and say look I'm about to go out of business I owe you 10 grand I can pay you three if you won't take three and settle the debt then I'll pay you nothing and you can take me to court but I'm going to close the business so you'll get nothing it's up to you give people that ultimatum they'll take the three grand I did this recently with a couple apartments for some cam girls I was rting some apartments for some cam girls cam girls left didn't need the apartments anymore I owed three months rent I said it was only like I don't know how much two grand a month in total so it's like six grand spoke to the landlord and said hey man I can pay you two grand because you onlye me six like yeah I know but the girls have left he didn't know the girls were cam girls so the girls were uh supposed to pay me they didn't pay me so now I'm in the hole you're in the hole we're in the same boat I can give you two grand out my pocket it's all I've got if it's not enough then take me to court he goes yeah I will take it to court I said okay take me to court no problem but I have no money to pay you so hung up the phone next day can you do three grand said no bro I'm sorry I got two grand it's all I literally have I'll see if I can do any more two and a half Bank paid it six grand down to two and a half what choice did he have take me to court and he wasn't getting no money I told him I didn't need the apartments can't kick me out I'm not there I already left so don't be don't be thinking about worried about debt you need to be worried about one thing in your business which is I'm not even going to draw it because you should know what is by now money in debt doesn't doesn't matter if enough money's coming in nothing matters if money's coming in I see people panicking and worrying about debts [\\xa0__\\xa0] debts get in debt get in debt if it's going to get money in you're a hustler because you know what's not real compared to cash debts if you had a company and you had a whole bunch of assets and you could lend $3 million against your company and you can get it from the bank take the three mil then listen to the lesson before take 2.5 mil put it in a personal account somewhere hide it then try and work carry on working your company try and pay it off and if you can't who gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] you work out a deal with the bank in the end you need to be about yourself you can't be afraid of debt to get there if I had to get in debt to get money in and I didn't have to repay it anytime soon and money was Flo pouring in I'll take it money in is primary debt is not nearly as scary as people pretend it is especially with a limited company what does limited mean limited liability means limited liability the company's debts are not your debts they're not yours [\\xa0__\\xa0] chill and most nine times out of 10 you could close the company open it again clear the debts off and have the same phone number and same [\\xa0__\\xa0] website just chill out about debt I get so many questions from business guys well but I'm in debt or I owe this I owe that [\\xa0__\\xa0] that how much money's coming in fix that stop worrying about other [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's not important I already mentioned this don't pay unless you have to but reputation management is so this is another key Point reputation management so with the the guy with the apartments the reason I pulled that move on him because he's not a Romanian and a Romanian I'm very well known here and it' be bad for my reputation the guy owns his Apartments was Turkish and he lives in Turkey so my reputation management I did the I thought okay well he can't damage my reputation so there's no need to pay him the Jewish guy the reason he didn't pay any of the invoices until he threatened to take him to cor because he didn't need the one supplier more than once so he didn't care he found a new supplier so he didn't need a good reputation don't damage your reputation of course if there's a supplier you need a reputation with then you must pay them if you don't pay someone they're GNA put all over the internet that you don't pay then maybe you need to pay them but if there's a way you can manage your reputation to stay intact and not pay they can [\\xa0__\\xa0] wait [\\xa0__\\xa0] them being nice guy ain't worth it man I'm telling you when I ran T2 and I had invoices outstanding and I had staff to pay and I had no money in the bank and I was chasing all these companies to pay their invoices the big companies the big boys they didn't care they care about me yeah we pay invoices takes up to 90 days up to three months to pay an invoice it's a bank transfer takes two minutes so how all these other companies are so you can be the same make them [\\xa0__\\xa0] wait [\\xa0__\\xa0] them next this is a key point for staff management HR is [\\xa0__\\xa0] what is HR you always see some [\\xa0__\\xa0] chick with a bad attitude I work in HR Human Resources human resources stupid [\\xa0__\\xa0] she sits around all day talking about human resources goes home puts a dick in her mouth Human Resources let me tell you how you run a HR department you're the leader as a leader you do the most work so people respect you and secondly you're positive positivity is your HR department remember me talking you about vixel how all my staff worked for free when I'd turn up be in a good mood buy pizza we're all going to get rich guys BM BM bum Wolf of Wall Street positive energy positive energy positive energy second I went away to Slovakia everyone quit there's a HR department positive energy is your HR department your staff are going to work harder for you and respect you more and be happier if you're happy be positive you've just fixed your HR department you do not need some [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] ho well if you don't work prop I'm gonna give you a written warning what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] written what be positive your staff will be positive that's how you have a [\\xa0__\\xa0] HR department that's how you make people work hard for you that's how you make people respect you HR annoys me to even [\\xa0__\\xa0] talk about it next people always say to me what do I sell I get this all the time but I don't know what to sell what what is a company you're selling something that's how you're getting money in but I don't know what to sell it doesn't matter what you sell it matters how you sell it this is super important you can sell anything I can sell anything I could sell anything cuz I'm a [\\xa0__\\xa0] G it's not about what it's about how how you sell it is more important than what you sell so there's people out there selling [\\xa0__\\xa0] complete [\\xa0__\\xa0] dick enlargement pills they don't even work so it's not the what it's the how Mass marketing spam email pathetic promises that don't work some company in the Philippines you can't track down or Sue they've put themselves in a situation where with enough numbers they're antifragile they can't be taken down and they can sell garbage it's not about what they're selling it's about how they sell it you can make money from pens you can make money from [\\xa0__\\xa0] cups you can make money from anything it's about working out a way to sell it that's going to work so when you're sitting there going well how do I start my business what do I sell forget that start thinking about how you can sell things instead if you start thinking about how you can sell things you can find out that the what isn't all that important so me for example let's look at me I have a wide reach I'm very respected people know I'm rich so I can sell anything with social media and with curiosity and with explaining to people that I have social proof and there's a reason you should listen to me I can sell basically anything with that I could take this pen and say every contract I've ever signed in my life I've signed with this pen and this is why all my contracts are new and I'm rich and this pen is $38 it's not what it's not about the pen it's all a how around it so identify your strengths and identify a way you can provide product and that will give you an idea on what the product should be it's not about what it is keep this in mind you can sell anything let's look at the cam girls for example so I'll give you a cam girls example so I had a girl she was struggling she goes I don't know what to sell I've tried selling videos they don't want it I've tried selling this I don't want it tried selling that I don't want it they don't want that no one's buying anything from me I said okay let's think of how we can sell something instead of what we can sell she goes what do you mean I was said okay so I was sitting there watching on the chat all the guys were saying to her like where are you what you up to I was like okay let's add some curiosity in and let's add in a how so what we did is we took her out of her bedroom put her in the bathroom and she started adding broadcast in the bathroom and Whispering I said they're like why are you Whispering she goes oh my my stepdad's here and he doesn't know I'm a camp girl so I have to be really quiet so it wasn't not what cuz she's doing the same thing she was doing before it's about the how now she's in a bathroom hiding from her stepdad and she has to whisper or he'll hear her guess her room went crazy everyone wanted her to use a vibrator then they were paying money nuts because she might get caught it's the same thing as before it's just the how you sell it it's not the what you sell do you understand the difference difference here I put a different how on it and she went from a nobody to a [\\xa0__\\xa0] hero and spent the next two months in a bathroom Whispering convincing these dorks online that her dad might hear occasionally I'd walk by and knock on the door and she'd have like people loved it it's not about what it's about how you see my genius do you see my genius I didn't think okay what could she sell well she tried videos it didn't sell she's tried pictures it didn't sell what else can she sell what else I didn't think what I thought okay let's stick to the same whats the same things cam girls it's not that complicated what does she sell she sells okay shows where she's a vibrators who sells videos how can we put a spin on these to sell them I didn't try and change the what I changed the how this is important you can sell anything if you work out the how you don't have to work out what it is next play to people's strengths this is especially important to with staff but it's also important with custom play The People's strengths so on a chessboard you have a knight and a bishop how do you win the game you use them to their strengths you make sure you understand how each of them works and use them to their strengths a lot of people have staff and they don't understand the strengths that their staff have you might have two receptionists on a desk but one of them's hot and one of them isn't and you have a really big meaning and the guys are coming or four 38-year old businessmen which receptionist should be on the desk but this is this is the kind of thing people don't think about I mean the answer is obvious but people don't think about it they'll just go okay yeah someone's at reception okay they're on their way and they'll just think it's all going to be fine no Details Matter play to people to their strengths you're going to have certain members of Staff who are more physically attractive than others certain who work harder than others certain who are more stress resilient than others certain who are more adaptable to changing hours than others you need to learn your staff and you need to understand them and need to use them play them to their strengths because everyone should play to their strengths just like you should if a weakness someone else should be working for you who does it I'm [\\xa0__\\xa0] with creative stuff that's why I have such amazing creative people working for me because I'm [\\xa0__\\xa0] with it even if I know in my head what I want I don't know about cameras and editing so I hired someone to do that but what I am good at I do so you need to play to your own personal strengths and your weaknesses need to be outsourced and your staff you need to play to their personal strengths need to be outsourced and your weaknesses of your opponents which are usually clients need to be exploited doesn't matter what it is you need to exploit people's weaknesses let's take uh T2 we'll do a T2 example and a webcam example so T2 I'd exploit people's weaknesses all the time people would sit there in the meeting with me and I say well are you selling enough product it's a stupid question well yeah we're selling enough but we'd like to sell more who [\\xa0__\\xa0] wouldn't yeah okay well TV's going to do that for you I just made them admit they've just shown me a gaping hole I want to sell more I will make you sell more okay sign here boom play their weaknesses against them with with my strengths very very simple I can sell your products do you sell enough already we sell enough we want to sell more okay we'll do a TV sign here bang done same thing with cam girls how to use people's weaknesses against them we'd have guys come along and say oh well I'm an old guy you wouldn't like me and the girl would be like no I'm tired of these young guys playing games I need a guy who's just ready to settle down play to the old guy thing or a young guy would come along go I'm not like these old creeps and the girl be like yeah I know thank God you're not like these old I talk to old guys all day it's nice to talk to a young handsome guy for once play play to their ego strengths and weaknesses everybody has them even me Lord Emperor Tate has the odd weakness very few but I've got the odd one you need to identify them in your staff identify them in yourself identify them in the people you're trying to convince to do business with you and use it against them because that's the reality of the world that's what you do with everyone and anyone you meet you exploit women who are lonely CU if they weren't lonely they wouldn't be [\\xa0__\\xa0] on a date with you in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] first place this is natural human nature so when you speak to people speak to clients speak to customers you need to identify their weaknesses where are they weak so if you're speaking to a company if I was speaking to a company for TV that was very big very very successful already sold what a product and didn't need to more sales then I'd be telling them about The Prestige of TV branding making sure that all of their competitors know that they're the flagship explaining that in their industry they're going to be the first one on TV and that in nearly every industry the company that went went on TV first held the market share and that you only get one chance to be first and if a competitor comes first they're going to lose that Prestige of being the first people within the bouncy ball company on television if I had a diff if I had a different client in the same industry who wasn't selling anything I wouldn't be talking about none of that I'd be talking about how the fact that we're going to sell a bunch of product we're going to get them up there we're going to make them the market leader you have to identify their weaknesses I worked out what they wanted what they needed to hear do you do that no you [\\xa0__\\xa0] should work it out this is down to once again a how to sell as opposed to what you sell so what's the famous thing they always say sell me this pen I've never done that in my life and no one's ever said it to me but it's not about the what it's about the how just like before just like I've told you so if you start saying well this pen is white and it has lots of ink and it can write for a long time you're talk you're talking about the what you're talking about the how s me this pen do you want to write down your ideas yeah I already have a pen yeah but you don't have this pen with this pen you can write down ideas you can't write down with that pen well why how do you know that's true because I've been selling pens for a long time and I'm a pen expert and I'm telling you this pen when you have this pen in your hand the way that the writing flows from your mind you're going to come up with multi-million dollar ideas that you never would have had before if you didn't have this particular pen I know all about pens I know about the pen you have and I know about the pen that you could have and this is a superior pen in every single way [\\xa0__\\xa0] the pen I haven't even talked about the [\\xa0__\\xa0] benefits of the pen I'll just put a spin on it and what else have I tied in with my sales pitch right there Curiosity he knows about pens this is the best pen Well it can't be that much better it is absolutely is blind confidence okay I'll try one pen he might like it and buy more he might not who gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] he bought the pen so it's not about the what it's about the how and you have to play to people's strengths and weaknesses keep this in mind identify their weaknesses nobody's weaknesses that they're pen runs out too soon that doesn't happen people's weaknesses are that they don't think of good things to write down that's a weakness I can't remember the last time someone had a pen and goes damn it I've had this pen for three months and it's run out of ink doesn't happen but I have seen people sit and right go I don't know what to write play the weaknesses and play the strengths think about it think outside the box next satisfy immediate need so I recently was having a conversation with a guy within one of my companies and we were discussing the backend of one of my companies and we were talking about needing a backend system to run the company and we were talking about how in the future if we don't have this system blah blah blah blah the future the future the future you know how you convince people to do things you satisfy an immediate need because people are lazy someone comes along to me and says you need this because in two years once you said in two years I don't care and neither does anyone else most people out here are stressed about [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's happened yesterday and [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's going to happen tomorrow they ain't got time to think about from two years from now if you want to sell somebody something you need to satisfy an immediate need immediate not later so it doesn't matter what you're selling but you need to look at your selling points and you need to be thinking immediate need I did this with T2 all the time companies will come on and go oh yeah we're interested in branding we're thinking maybe next year I'm like next year but when of your competitors will get on TV you need to be the first immediate need now they're starting to panic and think about it first they came to the meeting one talk about TV for next year now they're talking about TV for right now if I was sitting there go yeah well next year we can D IBS and butts candy and nuts maybe next year maybe I'll die in a car crash next week I ain't got till [\\xa0__\\xa0] next year you're a hustler this is what this is Hustlers University husters need money today you need money now you haven't got till next year you need it now so the only way you're going get people to give you money now is if they have an immediate need that needs to be satisfied right now no one's giving you money now for some [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's going to happen in the future immediate needs so it doesn't matter what you're selling or what client you're talking to find an immediate need for it don't talk about the future don't talk about legislation that's going to happen next month don't talk about how next year they're going to need say right now you need this because right now urgency Panic oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] now [\\xa0__\\xa0] how did I live without it oh my God now if you have any selling points that sell to the Future great they can be icing on the cake your cake that's really going to sell product is immediate need if you cannot identify someone in immediate need they're not going to buy it it's the same with absolutely anything even with cars so I never worked in car sales I actually really wanted to because I I would have been [\\xa0__\\xa0] good at it but because I'm so good at sales every time I buy a car when salesman try and sell me I know their tactics but it's very very typical of car salesman all the time go in there yeah I'm thinking of a new car next year but my car I've got now is fine for now yeah but you should get this car now well I've already got a car yeah but you need this one now because you'll save x amount on the fuel and you'll save x amount on tax and x amount on insurance and also this car has this new this new system the self-drive system so blah blah blah so when you're on the motorway cruise control da he doesn't say yeah okay next year maybe no it's like no no you need it now because he identifies immediate needs even if they're [\\xa0__\\xa0] even if they're garbage immediate keep this in mind you ain't got sales point and you ain't got a pitch if it's not an immediate need never assume work my kickboxing coach had a saying if I didn't see it didn't happen so he'd sit me there to bench press with 100 kilo bench bench bench he'd go out and talk on the phone he'd come back 20 minutes later my arms are obliterated how many did you do 62 no I didn't see it start again if he didn't see it it didn't happen if he didn't witness it with his own eyes it literally did not exist in the universe that's his universe that's the world he lives in he didn't see it didn't happen it's the same with your work don't assume work from your staff don't assume things are done check on them if you don't see [\\xa0__\\xa0] happen it didn't happen this is true of the world it's especially true I learned this one I knew this one anyway but it's especially true with like the cam girls I worked and I did 10 hours and I made videos if you didn't see it it didn't happen it's this way with 99% of things in life if you ain't see it it doesn't happen it's also you can apply this to Binary is thing are things done or not what you'll often have in business is you'll ask somebody something is this done yeah 20 minutes do you know what that means to me it means no it's not done still not done it happens all the time okay tomorrow okay yeah later no no no no is it done no if it's not done it's in the not done pile and until it's done and I can cross off the done and I can just forget about it in my mind it's not finished I want to see it finished and [\\xa0__\\xa0] done Pronto if you didn't see it didn't happen keep this in mind especially with staff because a lot of them are say oh and I did this today and I did that today and I did this marketing today and I had this idea and I sent these emails you didn't see it and you can't verify it if you can't check on it it didn't happen it needs to happen again and you need to watch it or you need to find a way to verify it oh you had this ID and you spoke to all these clients okay well I didn't hear you speak to them I ain't got time to check the phone record so we're going to call them again did anyone buy no okay let's call them all again I called them yesterday cool call them again didn't see it didn't happen doesn't exist next everybody loves a winner this can go down to how your brand works and how your company Works never ever ever admit a problem and never ever ever admit that you're struggling ever don't do that there's a guy on Twitter who recently started putting on his email list about how it's been a hard year of business for him that does not make people want to buy from you bro ites people not want to buy from you everybody loves a winner nobody loves a loser if you come along and say my business is fantastic we make so much money we have so many clients we're great you want to work with us we're doing fantastic people want to work with you if you come along and say well you know we're new and we're struggling we're new but we're we're we're small so we you know we value each customer because we're small no we're small but we make a lot of money because we do a very good job for our clients everyone loves a winner they're going to love you more if you're a winner nobody likes a loser no one feels sorry for a loser and no one trusts a loser no one has confidence in a loser if you're going to go in for brain surgery and there's two [\\xa0__\\xa0] guys there you want the guy who's like yeah easy easy no problem you want The Confident guy you don't want the guy who's like don't know first time I done one of these even if they the same qualifications people love winners they don't love losers and winners in life are Brash give a war look at me ultimate winner Mr winner what am I Brash confident arrogant so when I tell you I'm going to teach you [\\xa0__\\xa0] did I say I've run some businesses I think maybe there's a few things I could teach no I told you I know [\\xa0__\\xa0] everything I'm G to teach you [\\xa0__\\xa0] everything I know and I've made millions and you're going to make millions everyone loves a winner come across as a winner and people are far more likely to trust you don't be coming across as a loser never admit defeat never admit problems especially to customers and clients as far as they're concerned your company is perfect doesn't matter if your office is on fire you don't have to tell anybody you have to keep bringing in money your Warehouse is set on fire you know what I would do got this company I sell bouncy balls my bouncy ball Warehouse is on fire I come in on Monday morning my bouncy ball Warehouse is on fire you know the first thing I do first thing I do is I tell all my salesmen okay the warehouse is on fire we can't fill any orders call everyone up and try and get some orders the first thing I do even when my warehouse is on fire is tell all my [\\xa0__\\xa0] salesmen to try just like normal to bring money in because that's all the business is and that's all that matters and that's all that's going to fix your problems I don't say send an email out and let everyone know that our warehouse is on fire I don't sit and say okay slow down the orders because we're low on Bouncy Balls it can be hard to fulfill no no I say sell some [\\xa0__\\xa0] bouncy balls I'll fix it later get some money in the bank now next keep an eye on competitors and steal their ideas especially before they get traction because if you stick to the rules I've taught you thus far especially with speed you can overtake them anyway so if you see someone hey I did this the other day man I did this exact same the other day I saw someone launch a free telegram group on Twitter thought good idea so I stole their idea I started a free telegram group I'm in their group and my group and my group is five was bigger than theirs because I promote it six times a day with my staff retweeting and adding a new tweet with my link and he doesn't because he doesn't work as quickly as me if I would have sit around and waited or thought that was a good idea and did nothing it would have been much harder to catch him so the point is if you see a competitor idea steal it right away and then implement the most important business lesson number one speed and then you can overtake them keep an eye on the competitors and be ready to steal steal steel steel steal everything they do if you see your competitor start a GoFundMe start one why not but just advertise it harder blast it everywhere do things they're not prepared to do make sure your staff are get better pictures write better copy speed speed speed speed speed and overtake them and beat them even if you don't beat them just take away some of their momentum you sell bouncy balls so I don't know why we're on Bouncy Balls today but we are your competitors start to gofund me for their bouncy ball you start gofund me for your bouncy ball they raise 100,000 you raise 50,000 well if you didn't raise that 50 perhaps your competitor would have raised it because the people who are interested in bouncy balls may have gone with him instead of you so not only have you raised 50 but you've also taken 50 from him it's a double whammy it's not the fact that you've raised 50 it's that you've also taken 50 from him so if your competitor is doing anything steal his idea even if you're not going to pull it off just to take some of their momentum away so with the war room if I have any ideas on how I want to promote the war room I do my big ideas on the days that other groups are trying to open up for membership just to combat them just to take some attention away from them even if I don't get any of their guys it doesn't matter just so they don't have a free reign never give your opponent free reign because this is what your competitors are they're opponents so keep an eye on them and be prepared to steal their ideas even if it doesn't work that fantastically steal it and implement it purely just to slow them down but I'll tell you a few times I've done this and if you do it right and you do it with speed you can often overtake them and you can often beat them I've done it myself so trust me it's very very doable next I've spoke about this already but it's important money and business as a hustler is your life it's your life meaning it's all you do I'm not saying you can't do anything else I'm saying you mix everything together if you go for dinner try and go for dinner with some guys you need to talk to about business make sure your people around you your friends are talking about business if if you have to go somewhere try and go somewhere for business let's say you really really want a holiday your bouncy ball company you made a lots of money you really really want a holiday cool do you really want to go to the SE shells or could you go to India and have fun you've never been there before still got beaches and speak to another bouncy ball company while you're there maybe get some cheap product mix everything together you can find a way to do all the things you want to do with a business objective tinge trust me you can do it cuz I've done it myself even things as simple as with the cam girls I really wanted to go Thailand so I told all the girls okay if we make this much money this month I'll take you all to Thailand that was work they all worked their asses off they hit Target they felt like they got a free holiday I had to go there anyway and they made me a bunch of money always tie work into all the other things you have to do your whole life is work your whole existence is work so you can tie it all in in every single way because that's what Hustlers do Hustlers never turn their brain off of the money so anything you have to do in your life try and put a work tinge on it because it's very doable before you know it you'll see that if you're awake you're working that's how I live my life now it's 20 past midnight and I'm working if I'm awake I'm working soon I'll go to sleep until then I work that's how it goes right next develop a phone addiction if you don't have a phone addiction already develop one and maybe it's bad for your mental health and your happiness but we don't believe in Burnout so that ain't real I am very very successful in the realm I'm in now with social media it's because the amount of content I produce the amount of original tweets original ideas to YouTube channels the amount of ideas I have for courses the amount of speaking I do the amount of videos I lay out my Instagram Stories the pictures I take I am always on my phone anyone who knows me will say Tate lives on his phone if I'm awake I'm probably on my phone I live on my phone because my phone allows me to do so many things people who don't have phone addictions will tweet once write an email put their phone away and go about their day that's not how you get ahead if you're sitting there and you don't know what work to do here's what you do this is a very very simple way to start making more money it's very very simple go on your phone look at all

page Twitter if you can make money from Twitter your email whatever all the apps that can make you money you put on the first page and you sit on your phone and you refuse to put it down for three hours it's 1 o'clock I'm sitting on my phone till 4 pm you get your phone open it up first page and you refuse to put it down and you just keep going through the different apps and doing something you'll find work you'll be surprised you'll open up Twitter you'll write something you'll retweet something open up your email scroll through oh this this guy I haven't heard from this guy to why email him open up your gallery okay you got some product pictures actually this P this product might look good like this let me take a picture like this okay let me tweet that out just sit on your phone and just [\\xa0__\\xa0] do things with apps that can generate money develop a phone addiction you'll increase your [\\xa0__\\xa0] income I'm telling you I have a phone addiction because without my phone I can't make money with my phone I can make money this is the reality of the world phone addiction it's going to help you to make money it's absolutely true next nothing is too good to be true that you sell maybe they say that in life there's many things that are too good to be true but anything that you sell is certainly not too good to be true the bees knees what you sell is amazing this whole modesty honesty [\\xa0__\\xa0] ain't going to get you to the top it really isn't everything you sell is [\\xa0__\\xa0] fantastic and you can speak this into existence I've worked so hard on this because I've told everyone how great it's going to be so by telling you all it's going to be fantastic I've worked super hard if I didn't say that and I sold it much softer I wouldn't feel the same obligation to try as hard if you sit in front of someone and tell them look I'm gonna do a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I'm G to do an amazing job for you this I'm going to do an amazing job for you you're never gonna doesn't copyrighting you're never going to have a copywriter as brilliant as me you're never going to have a copywriter as punctual or as skilled as me you'll be a better copywriter for that person than if you didn't say it nothing nothing's too good to be true and you can speak it into existence everything you sell is fantastic you tell the cam girls all the time guys keep asking me what I do in private tell them you're going to give them the best private of their lives I'm going to give you the best private you've ever had and the guy would be like really why what are you going to do you're gonna have to find out but I guarantee I blow your mind maybe she doesn't blow his mind he doesn't come back who cares maybe he goes I blow my mind maybe he's a bit drunk and maybe maybe she does the same old [\\xa0__\\xa0] but he just loves it because she's hot who knows nothing is too good to be true nothing that you sell is too good to be true put that spin on it that's what people want we live in a world where it's difficult to get people's attention people have ADD people are constantly looking all over the place so if your offering doesn't come across this absolutely fantastic they're not interested we don't live in a world of mundane look at Instagram everyone's got supercars everyone's traveling the world everyone's got perfect bodies everyone's on the beach blah blah blah this is the world we live in now so you need to have a product that reflects that where people it doesn't matter what your product is doesn't matter it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] bouncy balls it needs to be something that people are like wow if if if even half of what he's saying is true I need that put that spin on it and also you're going to work harder and produce better results when you have that personal obligation next we're tearing through these lessons here because we got a whole bunch to learn if you guys listen to everything I've said to you so far far and you look at your company and you literally go through one by one every lesson so far and implement it in your company you're going to see how quickly things change I've given you a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] knowledge here every single one of these points is important every single one can be implemented next spot bullshitters now this is very very important for people you're going to do business with for business Partnerships for clients for everything spot bull shares and there's a very easy way to spot bull shares what you're really trying to do is find out if people have money or not and everyone pretends they have money when they don't do you know the easiest way to see if someone has money the car they drive I refuse to believe there's a man out there who's a multi-millionaire who still drives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] car yeah there's some there's some dorks but if they're that if they're that kind of person then they're kind of client you don't want anyway because they're tight fisted I see so many guys on Twitter I'm an e-commerce six figure multi-millionaire nine figureure eight figure talking complete [\\xa0__\\xa0] and they don't even have a nice car if you made nine figures bro you'd have at least one Lambo I mean I'm I don't make nine figures and I'm sitting on six supercars so what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] you talking about learn to spot bull shares and it's not hard I get email propositions twice a day hey Tate you make a lot of money I'm a nine figure Money Maker we can work together on spot bull shares same thing with people who come in to work for you let's say you're trying to hire a Salesman what what car does he turn up in if he turns up in a nice car he must have sold some product for the company before him he turns up in a [\\xa0__\\xa0] car he didn't sell much so say oh how would you go your last job oh I was the top salesman then why the [\\xa0__\\xa0] you in a toota and I'll ask people that I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I'll ask them straight I was the top salesman then why are you in a Toyota what do you mean well if you're the top salesman you made so much money for that company surely you got paid good commissions why are you a Toyota if they come back and go oh yeah well I sold the most and the company commission wasn't well they weren't paying me what I deserve that's why I'm here fine but if they start panicking oh spot bull sharers but people on the spot don't let anyone lie to you don't let anyone famous you because if you get famous you're a goose this is a word I invented in T2 geese are for faming and goose are for faming so geese and Goose I know you're sitting there thinking what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Tate talking about hear me out geese are all the people out in the world World once you start interacting with them and you get to know them a bit more personal they go from one of the geese to a particular Goose so you fam the geese to make them a goose and you famous the goose to get the cash do not let some idiot famose you by bullshitting you and either taking your money or taking your time when they're a liar do not be a goose for some dude to famous you fose to Goose you fam to geese you don't get fist or fam moo write that down if you don't know what I'm talking about watch it again because no one fouses me I got an email the other day from some guy take got business opportunity for you it's an Amazon store it's 30 grand and it generates profit every month you haven't got to do anything I'm like well how does that work because because I always I let people talk remember the business lessons let people talk how does that work we start a business we start an Amazon store with very little margin we we start selling sofas if the sofa costs us $10 we sell it for $10 in a penny we start building up loads posst reviews we build up loads of traffic when the Amazon storees at the top then we start selling them for 10 $15 now you got $5 profit you start building profit you don't have to do anything we do everything for you from start to finish cost 30 grand I'm like okay but there's a big chance here that you can famous me I can pay you 30 grand and there's no guarantees you can disappear it's like okay yeah where are you based have a personal meeting oh no we can't personal meeting we're based in [\\xa0__\\xa0] Taiwan okay so you're trying to famus me so but I let him talk I got his idea I came back in him and said look give me a store for a week let me check it out and then if I like it I'll by he wouldn't let me that was the end the conversation point is never I was trying to spot the bullshitters I'm 99% sure they were [\\xa0__\\xa0] I put them on the spot and I was making sure that I know end up a goose for someone else is faming don't do that why [Music] why so a lot of you who run businesses will get sales and you'll know how they bought they use their credit card you know where they bought on your website you know where they found out about you or who they heard of you from a referral from a friend but you don't know why they bought this is the most important question when's the last time you've asked some someone why they bought something you sell little electric motorcycles someone buys one have of you emailed them why did you buy our product and I know because because people don't ask because then it assumes like your product's low quality no you got to say hey fantastic decision we're collecting information you did made a really good choice you bought fantastic product we'd like to know your individual reasons why you bought oh I bought this electric motorcycle to commute to work I bought it to travel around my estate I bought it for my kid whatever the wise will tell you more about where to advertise and how to sell more products than the how's the where's or the whats or The Whens or all the other [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] that everyone collects everyone collects all the house wise wees W sorry the house wees W no one collects the wise this is the only reason I give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about the War Room how did you hear about me Twitter where did he Buy on ct.com what did he buy with he bought via gumroad with this card when did he buy a 1233 did none of that helps meell why did you join the war room I joined because I wanted to feel like I was part of a community and I in my local area so then when I advertise in the future I say do you want to feel like part of a community this is the question you need to find out why everyone bought because that will also tell you why more people will buy nobody asks why with the cam girls when my girls would get a good client a really good guy a top level guy they' say why do you choose me there are so many girls online that you can pick from I'm just curious why you picked me oh because you're really fun and bubbly or I love that outfit or I liked what you were doing here I liked what you were saying there ask your top 10 customers why why maybe seven of them all have the same reason now you know why you're getting big customers nobody asks why nobody asks why I'll get email after email please rate our customer service how was this what did you think of this no one asked me why I bought in the first place isn't this the only question that matters you need to identify the wise so you can create future wise why why is all I give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about I'm uninterested in anything else why do people buy so you need to if you have a customer base already understand that now they may say oh because you know what we have a good relationship and I trust you perfect then you know it's not about the product it's about you as a person that's good that's just as good as I really needed that product and you were the cheapest whatever that will teach you if you need to have cheap prices that'll teach you if you need to continue to be more friendly you need to identify why our my hosting with cob.com is done with a particular company I don't know anything about hosting it keeps going down it pisses me off but the guy who does my website James he believes in them and I think it's because they do some things for him which are complicated that he'd have to do otherwise and also their customer support is good his wise are there a fast hosts don't need they don't know this but my point is he has strong wise he wants to use them even though so far their service has been [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] but their wise exist and the wise are saving them and the wise will save you too if the why people if someone buy something from you and you ask them why and they say it's because you're a great guy and your product [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you know you need to play on the fact that you're a great guy if they ask if if they bought from you and you asked why and the answer is because it's cheapest and the product [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you to offer them a cheap replacement or a cheap solution why did they by because especially if you ask enough people you're going to find out what is the actual triggering triggering me mechanism for people to buy your products in the first place people buy from me because they trust me and because I have results if I say why did you buy from me CU Tate I've been following you a long time and I can tell you don't [\\xa0__\\xa0] this tells me that I need to be more authentic with my message show more receipts more proof more because this is why people bought and this is why people will continue to buy with the cam girls I came to you because you know what you're just honest and I and I've had all kinds of [\\xa0__\\xa0] from for girls I like that you're just yourself and you're not putting on an act you're not acting all sexy you're just chilling eating pizza and being yourself I've had cam girls sit there in their pajamas eating pizza being themselves that's why they got that particular client I've had other guys who come and say oh you're always dressed the best you always have sexy underwear on so it's the opposite but different girls have different customers different girls have different clientele different businesses have different clientele what is the why for people who have already bought from you and can you identify the why for people buying the future give people a why and the easiest way to give them a why is to work out the why that worked previously on people who've already bought from you why no one asks this start [\\xa0__\\xa0] asking also ask yourself why think of the last thing you bought why did you buy it why think about it doesn't doesn't matter what it is I bought water why I was thirsty okay so how do they advertise to me you're a water company you have a chance to put a billboard outside of a gas station what do you put on the billboard I'll tell you what you should put on the billboard so you can go on the billboard and go Evon from Mountain this is because this even big companies make this mistake but I'm telling you as a hustler I've made money and I know that Y is the only thing that sells Evon can put a poster up that says from Mountain volcanic Springs 6,000 years old blow the surface of the Earth menro Walter or they can put up a sign that says stop are you thirsty hydrate yourself Evon why did I buy the water did I buy the water because it's from a mountain spring 6,000 years ago or did I buy it because I was [\\xa0__\\xa0] thirsty if you advertise to my why I'll buy more so the poster should say you're thirsty maybe you don't even realize you're thirsty Evon why what's the why I bought water because I was thirsty you need to put a why on it and big companies even make this mistake selling pointless [\\xa0__\\xa0] from Mountain Springs D why I don't come to you and start selling saying husters University filmed with the best cameras in the war room with solid oak walls with a [\\xa0__\\xa0] whiteboard and a chest board like why were you going to buy this because you want to learn how to make money so I sell the why I'm going to teach you how to make money [\\xa0__\\xa0] ask people why and sell the why because not enough people do that right next lesson everything is a cell so I'll give you an example of this in T2 television we I made a mistake that Dan the crackhead corrected me on and the mistake I made is I had an opportunity to get credit when I didn't when I didn't get it so a client called me up and said hey uh Andrew hi we were supposed to start our campaign on the 10th we won't have distribution in place we need to start a campaign on the 15th I replied no problem okay no problem didn't make a difference to me I booked the time for the 15th no difference what I should have done is put a cell on it because everything is a cell what I should have done is go Ah that's a problem Air Time booked months and months in advance okay is it definitely the 15th because I'm gonna try and move this for you is definitely 15th yeah okay can you send me an email confirming you want to change your air time from the 10th to the 15th put it in writing for me I'm going get in touch with the TV channels because everything's already been scheduled so I'm going to get in touch with them I'm going to try and pull some strings I know I have some other clients who starting around the same time maybe I can move some air time around let me see what I can do for you and I'll come back to you okay or let me know bang come back to him six hours later okay I managed to pull it off removing everything I didn't do anything I put a cell on it like I did a bunch of work for him now he's like yeah well when I need to change my air time Andrew changed it yeah I remember remember Andrew they're good should we go to the other company or should we stay with Andrew Well Andrew before when we had problems he he fixed them for us he pulled some strings I didn't do anything so when after I said yeah no problem Dan said no you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] up I like why goes you had the chance to get some credit out of that company and to build a rapport and to look competent for no reason dang was a crackhead but he was a good salesman and he was right everything is a sale everything is a sale you're always doing them a favor and you do that by putting a sell on it everything's a sell everything's a chance to sell I've had customers come to me and say hey uh I want to order this product but I want to come in an unmarked package because it's for my wife I don't want to know what it is all my products already came in unmarked packages do I reply they already come in unmarked packages don't worry or do I reply okay what's your order number I'm going to make sure I put it in an unmarked box for you personally he'll tell me his order number okay all right let me get this done for you did to when it sent out just to let you know I've made sure the Box I've checked the box it's definitely unmarked that person is going to buy from me again because when they needed something I was there I didn't do anything I put a sell on it I took the credit for something I didn't even [\\xa0__\\xa0] do every single CH thing is a chance to sell all the time so let's say you're a video production company for example and the client goes oh I need it in this format this format this format this format instead of going yeah no problem go okay we usually take some time to convert or some of these formats can be quite big and quite difficult but don't worry I'll sort it out I'll make sure can you send me a full list of the formats you need this this is yeah okay I'll make sure the conversions are all done even when I film it I'll keep this in mind because sometimes the aspect ratio I don't even know I don't even know what I'm talking about right now I'm talking about complete [\\xa0__\\xa0] the point is I put on it so now the person's like yeah that person's really good I needed all the different formats and me just click a button I'm sure it's just clicking a button on the computer who gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] put a sell on everything at all times and many people throughout the sales process will often miss a chance to put a sell on something so if someone buys something for you and they want any kind of 1% request even if it takes no effort at all from you that is your chance to sell Harder by putting a spin on it putting a sale on it I hope that lesson's been driven home because I do this all the time not with cobrate not with these kind of products but with any kind of physical products all those kind of things I'm always putting a cell on it all the time sometimes I do have to do things sometimes it's not always as easy as doing nothing my point is make sure the client knows how you've worked for them that's an important Point next take every offer seriously so I when I was selling TV advertising I went to a meeting once with a guy and I sat down with him and he let me explain everything about TV from start to finish it was a three-hour meeting everything about how it works at the end he said okay I'll get back to you I called him up he said I'll get back to you anyway I got because I was working with Dan and we believed in hard closing I got to the point where I said look got to do TV now or you're not be able to do TV this year air time is filling up it's going to take time to get your advert approved by the advertising body because the kind of product you are we need time blah blah blah tried to hard Clos it and you know he replied to me he said Andrew I want to let you know that I was never going to do TV I never had any intention of doing TV but when somebody comes to talk to me about something I'll sit and I'll listen that is a smart guy that is a smarter guy than the guy who goes TV no not interested thanks let people talk Mr Amazon store I was never going to buy his [\\xa0__\\xa0] store still I said well how does it work and we put 1% product and we was one sent over and we build up the reviews and now if I ever wanted to start an Amazon business I already know something I already know a little trick I've learned something always let people talk to you never take every offer seriously let people speak even if you have no intention of ever spending any money don't get famous don't be a goose don't let their sales pitch work be smart enough to let them pitch you and play along without letting it work like when you're on a date with a bimbo and she's I'm a good girl you're like oh yeah I can tell you're a good girl when you know she's a ho don't fall for it cuz some people will fall for it in front of a slick operator they'll still fall for it don't fall for it but let them try because that's where knowledge comes from I used to say this all the time when I was once again when I was selling TV sometimes i' try the marketing manager they'd shut me down and I'd call up and try and get the MD sometimes I get the managing director and I'd say I'm just let you know that I had a fantastic offer to put your client on TV and your marketing manager wouldn't even speak to me about it get trying to get him in trouble he's like what do you mean put me on TV like we had an opportunity for paid advertising and also product placement with some free opportunities I'm trying to call your market manager and they won't even speak to me about it before you know it the market manager is calling me back because the boss has told them off some guy's trying to put us on TV and you're not even taking his calls so beef people make people have to listen to you and when people want to tell you something sit and listen but if you're a SM Smooth Operator and people listening to you you can close them but my point is this sit if anyone comes to you with any kind of offer Andrew I want to sell you an Amazon store Andrew I want to build you a back end for your website Andrew I want to design you a new website Andrew I want to be your copywriter Andrew I want to do this tell me why tell me what you'll do tell me why I should use you oh blah blah blah blah blah blah okay yeah okay okay okay no how do you think I know so much [\\xa0__\\xa0] like I [\\xa0__\\xa0] learned so much smart clever patience the main reason people don't do do this is because they're lazy oh I don't I'm busy and he's trying to talk to me about TV I'm not going to do TV should have listen to me because you would have learned a whole bunch of stuff you know what when you learn you'd learn during my pitch about TV You' learn the difference between TV and magazine advertising you're already doing magazines you learn about the difference between TV and newspapers you learn about why my adverts on TV are more successful than advertising on magazines and newspapers you might learn something about how to change your copy in your magazine adverse have more success you would have learned something but you're stupid ass didn't want to listen to me so when people come at you with offers let them pitch you but just don't buy anything unless it's really good do not become a goose me draw a goose don't become a goose next this is another really important point where people are [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you don't have to understand it to make money so let's use cryptocurrency at the height of cryptocurrency when it was all going crazy and Bitcoin was $20,000 and everyone jumped in and everyone lost money even me I lost a little bit everyone was getting involved in cryptocurrency so I had another boy who I knew who super involved in crypto we both put about 100 Grand in crypto for the next three weeks while I was working on other projects he was watching videos on how Bitcoin Works how The blockchain Works how the exchanges work and he's sitting there going and I'm like why are you watching that goes because we have money invested and you know you got to understand the market I'm like no you don't you don't have to understand something to make money from it I'm a hustler because what do you mean I was like no matter how many videos you watch and how much you know about Bitcoin it's not going to change the global bit coin Market it's either going to go up or going go down doesn't matter what you learn or what you sit and watch it ain't going to change you anything he disagreed with me strongly how could you put money somewhere you don't understand all right bro I understand up and down it's either going to go up or it's going to go down I understand that I understand how to get my money in and out I understand the important things I don't need to know about how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] blockchain works I really don't he disagreed with me three weeks later it crashed we both lost money you know what the difference is between me and him during those three weeks I made more money than him I made most of my lost backs I was already hustling on some other project while he was watching blockchain videos do you see the difference put it in I understand up and down okay whatever next bang bang speed next open this business bang next next okay launch the War Room next bang bang money money money money oh bitcoin's gone down whatever money money I've got new money when Bitcoin down went went down for him he's oh well the blockchain says starts watching more videos a you're not changing what's happened you don't need to understand something to make money from something you don't need to understand the chemical composition of concrete to sell concrete what you need is concrete that some will [\\xa0__\\xa0] buy what you need is money in and [\\xa0__\\xa0] dish some concrete out you need to know how concrete works and if you do need to know how it works you hire someone who knows how it works you do not need to understand things to make money from things people who think they need to understand everything to make money from it waste so much time you don't have that time to waste the cryptocurrency example is a perfect one to this day I have over a million dollars in crypto and to this day I don't know how [\\xa0__\\xa0] blockchain works and I don't care goes up or it goes down no matter how much I know about the blockchain ain't going to change whether it goes up or down it's going to go up or down it's with the gods do not waste your time spending energy on something that's not going to directly correlate to money in because that goes against the earlier lesson what's the earlier lesson money you spend any money you spend has to go back to the income you spend money does it add money in you spend time does it add money in you spend energy does it add money in researching the blockchain does that increase the price of Bitcoin yes or no no it does not equal money in so stop [\\xa0__\\xa0] researching it sure you could argue well if I research the blockchain maybe I can start some company around the blockchain you look like a geek we're Hustlers here it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] you do not need to understand things to make money from them what you need is people who are going to give you money that's what you need you don't need to understand everything about what they're giving you money for you just need them to give you money I'll tell you this as another example I right now as it stands don't understand really [\\xa0__\\xa0] HTML or CS [\\xa0__\\xa0] s or [\\xa0__\\xa0] HTTP or I don't understand any of it but I just use it and utilize it to get money I don't need to understand it I understand this and this is what you need to understand as a hustler you don't need to understand all the [\\xa0__\\xa0] you need to identify a why and make people buy from you don't waste your time [\\xa0__\\xa0] trying to understand every incy yes being super knowledgeable about certain products is essential and yes it will make you some money I'm not saying don't do that I'm not saying be a dumbo I'm saying there's a lot of time people spending energy on things they don't need spend energy on or trying to understand things they don't need to understand when the only key most important thing is this money in keep that in mind so let's look at my Forex program my Forex program is making money it's doing even better than the war Trading Academy it's making money I keep putting up receipt after receipt after receipt because I know why people buy from me people will buy from me because they know I'm authentic that's the why so I keep proving I'm authentic to continue to sell everyone who's joined the Forex program is doing fantastically do I understand Forex no I don't know how my Traders come up with the trades they come up with but I'm still making money with Forex I don't understand it how did I do this well I understood that I'm going to hire people like I said earlier who know something I don't so I went to Dubai with a doll retainer and hired doll trading team that worked for hedge funds the best in the business so now the only way people like you can get access to trading team is through me or with your own dollars and I'm cheaper they place a trade for a bank the bank makes 10% I place the same trade I make 10% you place the same trade you make 10% now we're rolling with the big boys now since I've placed that retainer have I sat at the graphs trying to understand how they came to the conclusions have I analyzed the Japanese uh economy to work out why they think it's going to go down against the Euro have I sat and watched news for 14 hours a day like they have or have I [\\xa0__\\xa0] just carried on my life I don't understand it I don't need to understand it I found people who understand it I've paid them a whole bunch of money they're competent and I know they're competent they're proving themselves competent and everyone's doing well I'm making money from Forex and I don't understand it if I can make 567,000 a day from something I don't understand doesn't just prove my point completely and now there's a whole bunch of Geeks out there who in my position would sit and go okay now I need now okay I'm making money from Forex got Forex team I need to understand why they place the trade to do I need to learn everything about Forex whereas I'm thinking I'm going to launch Hustler's University now okay maybe I could learn everything to know about Forex and replace them and save myself next year there's an argument for that I don't believe I can replicate in one year or learn enough in one year to have the experience that those six men have across 20 years of trip so in that mind in that perspective I think it's a waste of time trying to learn anything I'm not going to learn enough to replace them I don't need to learn anything because I live in a binary world can you replace them yes or no no then it doesn't matter if I'm 99% close to replacing him or 1% close to replacing him I can't replace him so it doesn't matter so instead of sitting around looking at Forex I launch husters University because I get [\\xa0__\\xa0] done I'm a hustler so you don't need to understand things to make money from them it's very very important right next I see a lot of people get into business and then by extension end up getting into politics politics is for big boy business politics is for Amazon politics is for the steel companies who have trade tariffs and [\\xa0__\\xa0] war tax Wars against China you're a hustler you're small time you're going to be a multi-millionaire and still be very very small time politics is a mental trap and it doesn't matter who president is it ain't going to change whether you're going to be successful or not even if the president changes and taxes go up I doubt the tax increase is going to be the threshold just enough to sync your business you're either a business that makes it or your business that isn't I doubt that a new president comes tax goes up 2% and then your business fails I know this happens with some businesses and some Industries and some sectors but in your particular case that's very unlikely politics is a mental trap you do not have unlimited energy you have a finite amount of energy and you cannot waste it forget politics you're Hustler forget politics completely until you're a multi-millionaire only then do politics matter because poor people are unimportant if you're still poor just forget politics all together this is a really key point I see people get into business and they start talking about oh yeah well we're going to lower the taxes through Trump shut up are you making millions of dollars no who cares about taxes care about this when this is big enough for the 1% tax increase to be worth millions care until then you're busy [\\xa0__\\xa0] dorks all my notes Here For My 100 lessons the lesson I've written down here is fusa goose and fisa Gees it's an important lesson you got from Musa Goose you got from mea geese see you guys don't understand what that means if you have the Hustler mindset that means something you're sitting there going what does that mean it means something so let me tell you the story of the time Glenda Saved Christmas so Glenda owned a company called bomb bomb which was organic lip bomb and it was CR it was December 17th and every single company had closed basically and we had no money for Christmas me Dan and Tristan and my one member of Staff when T2 was in his infancy for TV we had no money and we're trying to hard close business but it was too late to get them on TV for Christmas everyone wants to do TV next year why would they pay you just before Christmas they all like we'll talk in the New Year it's impossible to get money out of anyone and we're trying our best to hard cloth if you buy now you get a special discount on next year if you buy now we can get you bulk packages by the time it gets to New Year you can hit the ground running we can already have your advertising standards agency paperwork done every trick we can think of and eventually we through a process of a three-hour phone call convinced Glenda the owner of Bom Bomb to pay us half of an invoice of upfront which gave us like seven Grand which we split up between us so we had three grand each for the week for Christmas now to you that doesn't make sense you're like okay what's the point of the story the point of the story is we needed money Pronto so we did everything it took and sat down and thought of every hard clothes advertising standards agency hard clothes free airtime hard clothes creative hard clothes everything we could and we tried it on everyone and eventually what we managed to do was famose a goose does that make sense to you you have to famous a goose maybe if I didn't famous that goose in the new year she would have decided to do something else A Bird in Hand is worth two in the bush money in the bank is money you can spend money in the bank is not money you can spend the Moose the goose so one of my cam girls had a really big birthday two years ago on her birthday her cam birthday was my birthday and and she'd like have balloons and it would cost certain amount to pop a balloon there's a surprise inside and she'd have a cake and she'd drink shots and get drunk and have this big 12-hour show she made $10,000 in a day on her birthday for the year after she started saying to all her customers a couple months in advance don't forget my birthday and all her customers would say okay I'm saving I'm saving and they'd stop tipping her to save her save money for her birthday and she'd obviously still talk to them and give them lots of attention because they're saving for her birthday and I told her don't do that what do you mean don't do that I said that is a [\\xa0__\\xa0] terrible idea she goes why I said because you're not faming the goose you need to take the money now you don't need them to save their money you can save their money take their money now who cares if they tip you nothing on your birthday it's just a day if they've got money now famous it take it oh but I want a big birthday I want a big birthday I was like [\\xa0__\\xa0] don't you understand that these dudes are just going to spend the money somewhere else or change their mind or tip some other cam girl or they're going to tip you a amount they saved to your birthday which is less than the cumulative you would have had anyway if they tipped every day that they're supposed to she wasn't thinking of how to famous a goose she was thinking like most people think about business hi Glend dud you want to do TV probably in the New Year okay yeah I'll call you in the new year that's not faming a goose hi glender do you want to do TV yeah in the New Year fantastic if you don't do TV in the New Year we need to start right now immediate need right now it's it's about our company's go it's about to be Christmas exactly so while everything's down we're going to do all the advertising standards agency paperwork we're going to make sure that we can hit the ground running we're going to make sure that in the New Year we have no delays because in the New Year obviously lots of customers who are sorting out things for their campaigns and we don't want to have any kind of delays we don't to have any kind of we don't want to miss the window to be successful when do you want to be on TV ask her doesn't matter where her answer is March April November who cares yeah exactly so we are low on time to get everything ready because if we miss that window then we're not going to have a successful campaign it's my job to make sure your campaign is as successful as possible so the last thing I want to do is Miss that window so what I think we should start doing is advertising standing agencies paperwork now uh I don't know I need to speak to my husband okay well I need you to speak to your husband and I know it's upcoming to Christmas Etc what I just need from you is a commitment if you can give me a commitment so I know that we're definitely going to go ahead with the campaign we can start advertising standard paperwork usually we take 50% up front if you can pay 30% of a campaign now then we'll make sure that the paperwork's done in time so it's also M before Christmas so it's the first thing on the pile that gets done when they come back blah blah blah blah fam Glenda Saved Christmas we literally sat in the office when that bank transfer came and bought a bottle of vodka and drank it and we're laughing about how Glenda Saved Christmas because we had no money zero now we had money Glenda Saved Christmas we got on the phone and famous to Goose that cam girl was not trying to famous and guess what happened when her birthday came guess what happened who's always right hi babe I'm going to tip you but I couldn't save as much as I hoped because they were too busy tipping other girls they were getting your attention for free and spending the tokens they're supposed to be saving on other girls so they give you a big tip which is [\\xa0__\\xa0] compared to the cumulative all the tips you would had anyway guess how much she made on her birthday guess how much 6,000 she cried for three days stupid [\\xa0__\\xa0] told her no I just thought they really liked me you [\\xa0__\\xa0] idiot [\\xa0__\\xa0] famous the goose if I didn't famous Glenda and I called her in the new year she might be like oh well over Christmas we were watching TV and we decided that it's not for us or I was talking to my uncle and my uncle got me drunk and touched my [\\xa0__\\xa0] and now I don't want to do TV who knows who cares if you don't famous it it ain't yours you need to famous a goose you need to fam a geese that's a lesson I've written down here write it down so when you're sitting there going how do I make some money where's the goose where where's the gooes where's the geese fam them fam them does this make sense to you as a hustler it makes sense to me get this in your mind fusa Goose fisa Gees don't be let my cam girl [\\xa0__\\xa0] relying on the future don't let Glenda have Christmas with the money in her bank when it should be in your bank for moose a goose next this kind of ties into the whole don't get too legal before you get rich the rules don't make anybody Rich the rules don't make people Rich the rules are to be broken so I'm going to tell you the story of my biggest ever television deal and it ties in to my business card it ties into a lot of my lessons so I'm gonna need my board for this one this is a good story my largest ever television advertising deal was how I bought my first Aston Martin and it was 300,000 with a profit margin of around ,000 split three ways between me my brother and a Salesman called Gerald and this was for a company I may not have mentioned yet in in this [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing my career in TV was long in between T2 and vixel for a six-month period I ran a company called po Syle don't ask why random name sounds important and we sold TV advertising with our top salesman from T2 when I left T2 and left the company to Dan which he ran on his own and drove into the ground I started another agency with our top salesman who left T2 to come with me in Tristan we start po Syle so our largest of TV advertising deal was sky sky sold electronic cigarettes electronic cigarettes are not allowed on TV in England at the time they were not allowed on TV but we called them up and told them that we could get them on TV because we're experts at passing the advertising standards agency and that we could guaranteed get them on TV and they were very interested in speaking to us and we flew to Scotland and we went to the meeting and I remember when I flew back from Scotland checking my bank balance and I had like 300 pound to my name I was broke turned up in a nice suit and we convinced them we could get them on TV and we convinced them to do this 300,000 PB contract and they were so desperate on TV because no one else could possibly get them on TV that they paid half UPF front 150 another 150 when they were going to go on TV now what's the lesson here the lesson is this the rules need to be broken because following the rules will never make you rich if I would have followed advertising standard agency rules I would have never got rich I broke the rules and lied and I took all their money and I thought [\\xa0__\\xa0] it I'll find a way to get them on TV because just like my business car said if you give me the money I'll find a way I got them on TV now their advert didn't say electronic cigarette it didn't show an electronic cigarette but I got them on TV it was [\\xa0__\\xa0] random lifestyle pictures with a ending that led to a website and it was all curiosity so people thought what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] even is this I don't even understand so people go to the website because they didn't understand what it was and the website was their products but I still got my on TV it fulfilled my obligation how did I get rich how did how did I get my first to me that's a lot of money between me and tring 66 Grand in a day how did I get that money by breaking the rules you got to break the rules and you got to be prepared to take the money so someone comes to you and goes can you do this and you sit and go no you sit and go yeah I can this much make them pay find a way worst case you give the money back not saying be a scammer don't be a scammer be the kind of guy who can do the impossible they're very different things I did The Impossible like my business C said if there's a problem if there's money you're prepared to pay me for any service I will do it I will break the rules to get paid so you're sitting there going oh well this is how we do this this is how this is done when you do this you have to do this don't be a geek I've heard this from so many email copywriters oh you need to put your your your business address at the bottom of your emails against the rules against what the the email rules the email police oh the email police are coming oh no the email police oh do you hear about Tate he got shot dead by the email police [\\xa0__\\xa0] them [\\xa0__\\xa0] the rules I don't care about the email police I do what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] I want I will email you as many times as I [\\xa0__\\xa0] like unsubscribe then and I won't put an address on the bottom if I had to put an address on the bottom it would be fake because I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] because the email address the address on the bottom the post code the physical address at the bottom is not going to put more money in my pocket it's not going to add anything to my money so I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I can't explain even discussing it annoys me it's a waste of time it's a waste of energy I don't care because I care about money in so I don't care about dumb [\\xa0__\\xa0] I break rules all the business rules I break them all I do whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] I want as long as it brings money in I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] as long as it doesn't put me in jail I don't care if you're sitting here one of the greatest businessmen in history is the guy who ran that fire Festival have you seen that documentary if you have Haven watched the fire Festival documentary guy was a [\\xa0__\\xa0] genius he got a whole bunch of influencers got J J Ru got Emily ratowski whatever a whole bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] super beautiful models advertised this Festival on an island did exactly what I said promised there to

$100,000 a ticket for things that completely didn't exist and took Millions more now he's in jail so he pushed it too far but don't you understand the genius if he would have not done the second part and just stopped with the festival and just gone to court and been like yeah my staff were incompetent they didn't do the things they're supposed to do the government of the island changed their minds last it which is true and it ruined everything and I'm really sorry that I didn't deliver I'm going to try and pay back as much money as I can but he followed my business principles and he fed loads

[\\xa0__\\xa0] going and buying tents you wouldn't have no money no one signing up no payment processor and you'd be looking at tents [\\xa0__\\xa0] tents where's the cash fusus fames next lesson always always sharpen your tools so at T2 advertising we would every Friday in the morning sit and go through our television advertising pictures even though I'd had some people who worked for me for a solid year and knew it word for word we would still sit there everyone in the group and the experienced guys would pitch in front of the non-experienced guys to teach them something and we would constantly sharpen our tools if your tool is a phone pitch practice if your tool is an email pra get a copywriter to analyze it or analyze it yourself or do a uh double blind test with two different types of email practice if you're getting leads through advertising of course refine them always be sharpening your tools all of the time because your competitors are and you don't want to be the one left with the blunt a you need to be always sharpening your tools how are you getting customers XYZ fine how can we sharpen XYZ or try another way of XYZ or improve XYZ because XY Z is what leads to money in the bank and that's all a business is always be sharpening your tools if something's working now it probably won't work in six months so you need to find something else or you need to get that tool that is working now and needs to be sharper so it is ready for six months from now stay ahead of the game too many people find something that works and they start sitting on it can't sit on nothing not in this world because the world moves fast don't end up like Blockbuster Video do you oh everyone loves renting videos and if you do Netflix you can't buy popcorn boom not business dorks head of the game another point and the reason I say sharpen new tools is this good salesmen be salesmen become good by being thorough and once they are good they become lazy so my in in with TV my best salesman would become best because they would follow the script to the letter but once they started getting deals in they thought they knew everything they'd become lazy with their pitching this is how people are once they think you know it all you're lazy there's another reason why you have to sharpen your tools to remind yourself how you got good it's like being a fighter and I'm winning my fights with jab cross I'm good now I'm world champions I'm doing spinning kicks and all this [\\xa0__\\xa0] jab cross it's worked for a very long time got me to where I am sure add something to it maybe have an alternative maybe but never forget the basics always sharpen your tools all the time especially for sales guys if you're a guy out there and you're a sales guy and you and you land a few good deals one week I guarantee even though your pitch may be motivated even though you'll be happy your pitch is probably a little bit less thorough than when you haven't landed in any deals because you're like oh yeah people are buying from me easy now so hey man do you want do you want TV like no you got be back to the beginning back to the start gambler's fallacy doesn't matter if it's been red 10 times in a row the odds of it being red or black next time is still 5050 there's no more likely to be black than it is to be red just cuz it's been red a bunch stick to your tools sharpen them stay thorough especially when you get good because that happens a lot this is especially true in the digital world especially true with your online advertising especially true with your video production your cameras all the latest [\\xa0__\\xa0] that comes out the new tricks you got to be on top of it all when Instagram first came out there was no television advertising company in the world that thought we need to be May able to optimize videos for Instagram not it doesn't even cross their minds now there's a whole bunch of kids students kicking their asses at it with iPhones if they were the first people who thought about it Shar your tools stay ahead of the game they could have been the Instagram advertising gurus and made billions always be ahead of the game always sharpen your tools at all times and the fast moving Industries super important next create problems and instantly solve them sell on problems so why are you here why are you in hust University because you want to learn how to make money so how did I sell this to you I told told you you don't understand money you don't understand how money is made and I'm going to fix it that's what I said to you now you're here have I done a good job yeah I didn't lie to you I didn't con you but did you see I identified and sold on the problem earlier when I was talking about the pen what did I sell on the problem you can't write your ideas down properly you don't have this pen you have to sell on the problem television advertising I sold on the problem you're not reaching enough people how can you sell more if you don't reach more people how can you be seen as a premier brand if you're not on TV problem solution here is your problem even though you don't know you have it here's the solution that I can provide doesn't matter what you sell bouncy balls give them a problem if you drop your ball it breaks but if you drop my ball it bounces but why does that matter well why do you want to break your stuff you don't want to break anything you're going to buy a ball you need to buy my ball so it never breaks I'm going to give you a special deal on this ball right now identify problem and sell if you know if you can identify a problem with people couple that in with the why you going to sell [\\xa0__\\xa0] all day long all day long so even my cam girls did this man even my cam girls would do this they'd be talking to a guy and they wouldn't say come private I'm so horny they'd give them a problem they'd say you're not satisfied I can tell I'd be like LOL what do you mean I don't know I can tell by the way you talk I don't think you're really satisfied when's the last time you came really hard the guy's like uh well uh even they had a last week with my wife or you're right or it doesn't matter what they say you've now told him there's a problem he was fine until you told him there's a problem now he's thinking oh yeah maybe maybe what's the solution I have an idea I'm going to do something I have an idea let's do it private it's going to take a long time but I promise I promise it's going to be different than anything you've ever done I think it's going to drive you crazy even the Privacy the same who cares identify the problem you have a problem I have a solution if a cam ho can do it you can do it you have a problem doesn't matter if you're selling [\\xa0__\\xa0] one of the guys in the War Room selling oil pipe equipment you need this new valve no we don't yes you do because the valve you're using is not as efficient as these Valves and you're wasting money problem wasting money solution my valve doesn't matter what it is if people don't know there's a problem they're not going to buy tell them there's a problem so you need to find out whatever you're selling and you need to find a way to tell the people out there the mass Market that they have a big issue big issue you need this so all my cam girls did the same thing I can tell you're not satisfied Bang have to do it basic tricks next and this is a very very important key key buying from you should make people feel happy and important because if you do that they will never stop buying from you people want to be happy and people want to feel important and most people are not happy and most people don't feel important buying designer clothes spending $200 on a [\\xa0__\\xa0] t-shirt is done so they feel happy and important I'm wearing designer buying from you should make people feel happy and important one way or another even if you're selling gas valves gas valves or bouncy balls something boring then you send them a [\\xa0__\\xa0] fruit basket the next day who gives this [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's 20 bucks something so they feel important and happy doesn't matter what it is you need to find a way that people who they buy with you they feel important and happy everyone who buys from me feels happy and important because they're getting exclusive knowledge this is the reason I don't go mainstream with cold traffic the reason I don't go mainstream with cold traffic and become like Ty Lopez and I'm would make a lot more money it's because then my people who buy from me won't feel happy and important because everyone would have oh everyone Andrew Tate yeah he's yeah I've seen H you have you seen H University yeah yeah everyone's seen it you guys have stumbled across a dark portion of the internet and you're getting all these secrets from a guy who refuses to go mainstream I do that particularly so you guys are very happy with your purchases knowing information that other people don't know so that's an angle I've developed it doesn't matter what you're developing angle is it doesn't matter but you need people to feel happy and even more importantly you need people to feel important when they do business with you you I've done business with this person this is why people pay stupid retainers to the big advertising agencies they pay crazy money because they get to do business they get the prestige that comes with it find a way to make all of your clients feel prestigious doesn't matter what it is if you do that you're going to have a lot of repeat business and people it's going to be much harder to steal them from you so it doesn't matter what your industry is you just sit and think how can I make the people who buy with me or do business with me feel prestigious and important so let's say you're selling a copyrighting course who gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] you sell a copyrighting course you email them all afterwards hey guys

It seems simple enough, but\\neveryone tries to skip to the ‘make money’ part. It doesn’ t work. I\\ntried. Y ou need all  the pieces. Y ou need the stuf f to sell - an of fer .\\nY ou need people to sell it to - leads. Then you gotta get those\\npeople to buy it - sales. Once you put all those in place, then you\\ncan make money .\\n \\nMy first book, $100M Offers, covers the first step and gives you\\nthe stuff . It answers the age old question “What should I sell?.”\\nAnswer - an of fer so good people feel stupid saying no. But\\nstrangers can only buy your stuf f if they know you exist. This takes\\nleads. “Leads” mean a lot of dif ferent things to a lot of dif ferent\\npeople. But most agree that they’re the first step to getting more\\ncustomers. In simpler terms, it means they’ve got the problem to\\nsolve and the money to spend.\\n \\nIf you’re reading this book, you already know leads don’ t\\nmagically appear . Y ou need to go get them. More precisely , you\\nneed to help them find you so they can buy your stuf f! And the\\nbest part is, you don’ t have to wait…you can for ce  them to find\\nyou. Y ou do that through advertising. Advertising ,  the pr ocess of\\nmaking known , lets strangers know about the stuf f you sell. If more\\npeople know about the stuf f you sell, then you sell more stuf f. If\\nyou sell more stuf f, then you make more money . Having lots of\\nleads makes it har d to be poor .\\n \\nAdvertising lets you have a terrible product... and still make\\nmoney . It lets you be terrible at sales…and still make money . It lets\\nyou make a ton of mistakes and still. make. money . In short, having\\nthis skill gives you endless chances to get it right .\\n \\nAnd in the unfor giving world of business, second chances are hard\\nto come by . So you might as well load up. Advertising is a skill\\nworth having .\\n \\nAnd this book, $100M Leads , shows you exactly  how to do it.\\n \\n***\\n \\n$100M Leads  sits atop the foundation of my first book, $100M\\nOffers . It assumes you already have a Grand Slam Offer to sell -\\nthe stuf f. Once you have an of fer to sell, it creates the next\\nproblem– Who do I sell it to? This book is my answer to that\\nquestion. Leads. Lots of leads.\\n \\nAnd before you know how to get leads, life sucks.  Y ou don’ t know\\nwhere your next customer will come from. Y ou scramble to cover\\nrent and pay bills. Y ou worry about laying people of f, putting food\\non your table and… going under . Y ou work your hardest to\\nsucceed, and others laugh at you for trying. It feels like death. I’ve\\nbeen there. I get it. This book puts you in a better situation. One\\nwhere you’ve got more leads than you can handle and more money\\nthan you can spend.\\n \\nHere’ s How:\\n \\nFirst, it explains how advertising works.\\n \\nSecond, it reveals the four core ways to get leads.\\n \\nThird, it shows you how to get other people to do it for you.\\n \\nFinally , it wraps up with a one-page advertising plan you can use\\nto grow your business today .\\n \\n***\\n \\nOnce you know how to get leads, life gets easier .\\n \\nAs for why you should blindly listen to me about getting more\\nleads - don’ t. Make up your own darn mind! But, in the spirit of\\n“walking the talk,” here’ s my track record:\\n \\nI advertise in a variety of industries through my holding company\\nAcquisition.com. Our portfolio includes software, e-commerce,\\nbusiness services, consumer services, brick & mortar chains,\\ndigital products, and plenty of others. T ogether , they make\\n$250,000,000+ in annual revenue. And they do it by getting\\n20,000+ leads per day selling of fers from $1 to $1,000,000+.\\n \\nOn the personal side, I have a lifetime average return on\\nadvertising of 36:1. That means for every $1 I spend on\\nadvertising, I get $36 back. A return of 3600%. Some people built\\ntheir wealth in the stock market. Others in real estate. I built mine\\nadvertising.\\n \\nThis year I surpassed $100,000,000 in net worth at age 32. And if\\nyou’re from the future, that’ s in 2022 US Dollars. Which, much to\\nmy dismay , came with no flyers. No awards. No parades. I’m still\\n2000x poorer than the richest man in the world. My life is pretty\\nmuch the same. I’m still the same height, married to the same\\nwoman, and graying faster than when I was poor .\\n \\nIn these pages, I share the skills responsible for the bulk of my\\nmaterial success. I did it all using the advertising methods in this\\nbook. I left nothing out. This isn’ t a book of theories or armchair\\nanalysis. This book is built on what worked for me. And I wrote it\\nhoping it’ll work even better for you.\\n \\nT o answer a question I got after releasing my first book: \"Why do\\nyour books look like they’re written for kids?\" The answer is\\nsimple: my books must be books I would read. And I have a short\\nattention span. As such, I liken my reading preferences to that of a\\nchild: short in length, simple in words, and with lots of pictures.\\nThese books are my attempt to do that.\\n \\n$100M Leads is about getting strangers to show interest in the stuf f\\nyou sell. And once I transfer that skill to you, it’ s your turn to use\\nit. \\n \\nW ith that out of the way…let\\'s get rich, shall we?\\n \\n\\n\\nH o w  I  G o t  H e r e\\n“Hope is being able to see the light despite all the darkness” -\\nDesmond T utu\\n \\nMar ch 2017.\\n \\nI felt hurried taps on my shoulder while working at my desk. It was\\nLeila, my (then) girlfriend and business partner .\\n \\n“What’ s up? Y ou alright?”\\n \\n“W e have a problem.” She said.\\n \\nWhat now?  I thought.\\n \\n“Look at this.” She shoved a stack of books out of the way to make\\nroom for her laptop.\\n \\n“What am I looking at?” I squinted.\\n \\n“A disaster .”\\n \\nShe ran her finger down the screen to direct my gaze.\\n \\n-$99… -$499…-$499… -$299…-$399… -$499…-$499…\\n \\nEvery other number was more than my rent.\\n \\n“What are these?”\\n \\nShe started scrolling. “Refunds. All of them. From the two gyms\\nwe launched last month.”\\n \\n“W ait. How? Why?”\\n \\nShe scr olled mor e.  “I got lots of weird texts last night from the\\nmembers we sold at the Kentucky gym. I guess the owner stood up\\non a chair and told everyone to refund and go home. He didn’ t\\nwant to deal with all the new customers.”\\n \\n\"That\\'s insane,\" I said.\\n \\nShe was still scr olling.  \"Y eah, and the other gym owner told his\\nnew customers he would take them for half price if they asked for\\nrefunds from us and paid him instead.”\\n \\n“W ait what? They can’ t do that.” I said.\\n \\n“W ell, they did.” She scr olled faster , the numbers blurr ed .\\n \\n“Have you called them? That’ s not allowed in the agreement.\" I\\nsaid.\\n \\n“Y ea. I know . They’re ignoring my calls.”\\n \\nI put my hand on hers. The refund waterfall froze in place.\\nHundreds of droplet-size reminders of how much I sucked.\\n \\n“How bad is this? How many refunds? Just cutting profits? Or\\nenough to go negative and owe money?” I tried to keep my voice\\nsteady . I failed.\\n \\nLeila paused before answering. “It’ s a hundred and fifty grand.”\\nThe number hung in the air .  “...we won’ t be able to pay my\\nfriends.”\\n \\nTheir faces flashed through my mind, and the little hope I had\\ndrained from my chest. A month earlier , I got her friends to quit\\ntheir jobs for this. Now I had to tell them I didn’ t have the money\\nto pay them.\\n \\nShe continued. “W e can’ t sell our way out of this either . It’ll just\\ncreate more refunds to deal with. And we’re out of money .” Her\\neyes met mine, looking for the answers she deserved. I had\\nnothing.\\n \\nI felt sick.\\n \\n \\nA year earlier-\\n \\nI was good at getting leads for my gyms. I scaled to five locations\\nin only three years. My claim to fame was opening my gyms up at\\nfull capacity on the first day . So, I opened as many as I could as\\nfast as I could.\\n \\nMy fast pace started getting attention. I got asked to speak at a\\nconference about my advertising method. T o me though, I didn’ t\\nthink my process was special. I figured everyone was doing it. So,\\nI walked through my presentation hoping I wasn’ t boring the\\naudience. They were silent.\\n \\nThe moment I stepped of f stage, a mob formed around me. They\\nhurled questions at me left and right. I could barely keep up. They\\neven followed me into the bathroom. I felt like a celebrity . It was\\nwild. T o this day , I’ve never been more bombarded in my life.\\nEveryone wanted me to teach them how to do what I had just\\npresented. They wanted my help. Me. But I had nothing to sell\\nthem. Although, over one hundred people left me their phone\\nnumbers and business cards in case I did. Then a wild idea came to\\nme.\\n \\nI could make some money doing this…\\n \\n3 months later–an idea turns into a business\\n \\nSince I used advertising to launch my gyms at full capacity I\\nthought, maybe, I could “launch” other people’ s gyms to full\\ncapacity , too. I called the company Gym Launch. Original, I know .\\n \\nMy of fer was simple. I’ll fill your gym in 30 days for fr ee. Y ou pay\\nnothing. I pay for everything. I sell new members and keep the first\\n6 weeks of membership fees as payment. Y ou get everything else. If\\nI don’ t fill your gym, I don’ t make money . Y ou spend nothing either\\nway .\\n \\nIt was an easy of fer to sell. I’d fly out. T urn on my lead machine.\\nW ork the leads. Then sell the leads. Except, instead of selling them\\ninto my gym, I’d sell them into whatever gym I was camped at for\\nthe month. Every month I’d go to a new gym. Rinse and repeat. It\\nworked.\\n \\nW ord of this kid who’d fill your gym for free got around fast.\\nUnless I hired help, referrals would’ve booked me out for more\\nthan two years straight. I couldn’ t keep running my gyms and\\ndoing this, so I sold my gyms and went all in on Gym Launch.\\n \\nI saw a problem though. I filled their gyms, and they  got to keep all\\nthe long-term profits. I left so much money on the table. But, if I\\nwere part owner of some of the gyms, I could stack revenue month\\nover month. Bingo . Not much later , one of the gym owners made\\nsuch an of fer . W e’d be fifty-fifty . I would fill the gym with\\nmembers, and he would fill it with staf f. W ith this new model, I\\ncould open up 1 to 2 gyms per month and own them all. This\\nwould work much better than only collecting the upfront cash. A\\nwin-win partnership.\\n \\nA slight hitch in the plan, though. My new partner had “poor\\nfinancials.” So nice guy Alex of fered to pay all the expenses and\\ntake on all the liability for the first launch. I personally guaranteed\\nthe lease and would spend my  time and money to fill it with\\nmembers. Once filled, I would hand the gym over to him. I put all\\nthe money from selling my gyms, including my life savings, into\\nthis \"launch and go\" model. It took everything I had.\\n \\nA few weeks later , halfway through the launch, I woke up to find\\nall the money in the account gone. All of it. The partner accused\\nme of stealing and took the money as “his share” of the profits.\\nBut, we hadn’ t made any pr ofit . Then, he sent the money to a\\nforeign contact and filed for bankruptcy . That\\'s what he told me\\nanyway . When I of fered to walk through the financials and account\\nfor every dollar , he refused. That’ s when I knew I had made a\\nterrible mistake.\\n \\nIt turns out he had been indicted for fraud a few years earlier . And\\nto make matters worse, I alr eady knew . He told me it was “just a\\nbig misunderstanding.” I believed him. As the saying goes, when\\nmoney meets experience... the money gets the experience, and the\\nexperience gets the money . Lesson learned.\\n \\nIn three months, I went from a successful multi-location gym\\nowner . T o selling all my gyms. T o a cool new launching gyms\\nthing. T o completely broke. Everything I made from selling my\\ngyms was gone. My life savings was gone. W iped out. All of it.\\nFour years of work, saving, sleeping on the floor– erased in a…oh\\nno… Leila .\\n \\nLeila quit her life as she knew it to do this with me. She weathered\\nmy constant changes. She supported me in the half-baked\\npartnership even though she opposed it. Even with this huge\\nfailure, she never once even hinted, I told you so . Instead, she told\\nme, “The Gym Launch model is still good. Let’ s do more of\\nthose.” So we did.\\n \\nI put $3,300 per day  on a credit card to pay for ads, airfare, hotels,\\nrental cars, etc. for six sales reps. Leila’ s friends. I say this lightly ,\\nbut I covered what a nightmare it was in the first book. So I won’ t\\nrepeat it here.\\n \\nIn the first month, we launched six gyms and collected $100,1 17.\\nW e made enough to cover the $100,000 credit card bill. And for\\nthe record, that meant I was still broke. The next month we made\\n$177,399 with $30,000-$40,000 in profit. It gave me some room to\\nbreathe. Finally .\\n \\n \\nAnd that’ s when Leila tapped me on the shoulder to share\\n$150,000 worth of bad news.\\n \\nNow you’re caught up.\\n \\n \\nThe morning after Leila told me we had $150,000 in refunds and\\nlost all our money . Again.\\n \\nA honking horn startled me at 3 AM. My problems flooded back.\\nW elp. I’m awake now . I pulled myself out of bed and slinked to my\\nwork corner . I walked over out of habit more than desire. I slid the\\nchair out and plopped down - notebook and pen at the ready . I had\\nto make $150,000 in profit, not revenue, in thirty days. And I had\\nto do it with no money to my name, and no experience making that\\nmuch profit in a month. Ever .  So I started scribbling ideas:\\n \\n…Char ge an upfr ont fee for new gyms\\n \\n…Ask for a per centage of r evenue fr om old gyms\\n \\n…Get gyms I alr eady launched to pr e-pay for a futur e launch\\n \\n…Call every old customer and sell them supplements over the\\nphone\\n \\nI kept penciling the math. None of these would make enough\\nmoney . Not in thirty days anyway . I felt glued to the chair . I have\\nto figur e this out . I stared at the notebook, hoping it knew\\nsomething. It didn’ t. God I suck .\\n \\nA few hours later , Leila woke up. Like clockwork, she walked into\\nthe kitchen and poured a cup of cof fee. She got straight to work at\\nthe kitchen table behind me. \\n \\n“Whatcha doin’?” I asked, trying to distract myself.\\n \\n“Check-ins with online fitness clients.” she said.\\n \\n“What does that bring in again?”\\n \\n“$3600 last month.”\\n \\n“What do you char ge?”\\n \\n“300 bucks a month. Why?”\\n \\n“How long does it take you?”\\n \\n“A few hours a week”\\n \\n“And there’ s no overhead? just time?\"\\n \\n“Y ea…why?”\\n \\nI plowed on “I know these are old personal training clients, but do\\nyou think you could do it with strangers?”\\n \\n“I don’ t know…probably…what’re you thinking?”.\\n \\n“I think I have something.” I said.\\n \\n“W ait, for what?”\\n \\n“T o come up with the hundred and fifty grand.”\\n \\n“What, my online training? How?” She looked skeptical.\\n \\n“W e just cut the middleman and sell direct. I think I can just run\\nads to a sales page that books phone appointments. Then we can\\nsell the fitness programs we’ve been selling at the gyms, but sell it\\nas an online program. W e already have the materials. W e already\\nknow the ads work. And there won’ t be any cost to fulfill. Plus, no\\nmore flights. No rentals. No motels. And no gym owner telling\\nthem to refund...”\\n \\nShe hesitated. “Y ou think it could work?”\\n \\n“Honestly…no idea. But every day we don’ t do something is one\\nless day to come up with the money .”\\n \\nShe thought hard. “Alright, let’ s do it.”\\n \\nThat was all I needed.\\n \\nI worked thirty-eight hours straight to make the of fer go live. A\\nfew hours later , leads started flowing. She took her first call the\\nnext day . I walked in as the call finished:\\n \\n“$499...yea…and what card did you want to use?” she had the\\ncandor of a pr o .\\n \\nA few minutes later , I asked with anticipation, “W as that a sale??”\\n \\n“Y ep.” Dang, she is  a pr o .\\n \\nI even snapped a pictur e of Leila closing our first sale because it\\nfelt so momentous.\\n \\nW ithin days, we were doing $1000 per day in online fitness sales.\\nW e also got the cash up front with almost no risk of refunds. This\\nwas working . But, we were still way  short of the $150,000.\\n \\nAt lunch, she listened to my master plan between mouthfuls.\\n“Okay , the sales guys can stay home and sell this over the phone. If\\nthey do the same $1000 per day as you, with eight guys, we should\\nhit $8,000 per day . In thirty days, we’ll make $240,000. After ad\\nspend and commissions, we\\'ll have enough to cover the $150,000.”\\n \\n“What about the gyms we’re supposed to launch?”\\n \\n“I’ll call \\'em and tell ‘em we’re going in another direction. They\\nhaven\\'t paid us anything, so there’ s not much they can object to.\\nI’ll start calling them after lunch.”\\n \\nThe first call was to a gym owner in Boise, Idaho.\\n \\n“Hello?”\\n \\nI looked down to read the bullet points on my little script. “Hey\\nman - we’re not doing launches anymore. W e’re selling direct-to-\\nconsumer weight loss. So we won\\'t be coming out and–”\\n \\nHe interrupted. “But I r eally  need this right now . I just refinanced\\nmy house and maxed out all my credit cards to keep my gym\\nafloat. I put my life savings into this place. Is there any way you\\ncan help me? Y ou launched my buddy’ s gym. I know what you can\\ndo.”\\n \\nGiven my worse than yours  situation, I didn’ t care how bad his\\nfinances were. So I tried to sound polite. “I get that it’ s a hard time,\\nbut we’re not flying out. I’m sorry .”\\n \\n“Okay , okay . I get you can’ t fly out. But is there any way you can\\njust show me what to do? W e really need this.\"\\n \\nI was beat up, exhausted, broke, and felt betrayed by the entire\\nindustry . I should have said “no” but instead, I said… “Fine. I’ll\\nshow you how to get leads, but I\\'m not flying out there to save you\\nif you can’ t sell.”\\n \\n“T otally get it. It’ s on me. I can close. I just don\\'t have anyone\\nwalking in the door . I need LEADS. How much to show me how to\\nlaunch?”\\n \\nI looked down at my script. This is not how it was supposed to go .\\nI wanted to say no and hang up. Our weight loss of fer was\\nworking, and I didn\\'t want distractions. He’d already told me he\\nwas broke, so I said the biggest number I could think of to get him\\nof f the phone.\\n \\n“$6000. Consider it my ‘selling my secrets’ sale.”\\n \\n“6k?”\\n \\n“Y es. Six thousand.” I said, articulating the whole number , hoping\\nto scare him of f. \\n \\n“6k? Okay - done.”\\n \\nWhat . I stood there slack-jawed, frozen in disbelief. Six. Thousand.\\nDollars . I floated out of myself and watched the conversation\\nhappen. I still get choked up thinking about it.\\n \\n“Oh…uhh…great…what card do you wanna use?” Now , trying not\\nto scare away the Six. Thousand. Dollars . Panicked, I wrote his\\ncard information on the flap of a cardboard box.\\n \\n“When do I start?” he asked.\\n \\n“I’ll send you everything Monday morning.” Giving myself the\\ninsane task of packaging my entire gym leads and sales system in\\nforty-eight hours. He agreed.\\n \\nI hung up and sat in shock. Once I came to my senses, I ran the\\ncredit card. $6000…success. Is this r eal?\\n \\nI desperately wanted to tell Leila, but she was on a sales call.\\nFifteen minutes later , she walked in.\\n \\n“Got another one,” she said.\\n \\n“Y ou won’ t believe this. I just sold our Gym Launch system for\\n$6000 to the gym in Boise.”\\n \\n“What? I thought we were doing weight loss.”\\n \\n\"Y ea, I know . So did I, but…” She waited. “…I think we’re still in\\nthe gym business…I think we were just doing it wrong.” She\\nneeded more details. I didn’ t have any yet. “I’m gonna call the\\ngyms we planned to launch next month and see if they’ll buy it\\ntoo.”\\n \\n“Uhhh…okay .” She said.\\n \\nThe next call went the same except when he said “How much?” I\\nsaid, “$8,000.” He agreed.\\n \\nNext call, same thing, except I said, “$10,000.” He agreed.\\n \\nAll eight gyms we planned to launch said yes to licensing the\\nlaunch materials instead. In a single day , I collected $60,000\\nselling something with zer o cost to fulfill . In a single day , I was a\\nthird of the way out of my $150,000 prison. I spent five years\\ndeveloping that advertising system. It finally paid of f. Doing the\\nthing that scared me most - giving away my secr ets  - led to the\\nbiggest breakthrough in my life.\\n \\n“I can’ t believe it,” I said. “I think we can get out of this.”\\n \\n“So… are we not doing the weight loss thing?”\\n \\n“No. I guess not…I think we’ve had something here all along. W e\\njust had to put the pieces together .”\\n \\n“Do you think anyone else will buy it?”\\n \\n“I’m gonna call the thirty gyms we already launched. They know\\nour system works because we did it in front of them. W e also have\\nsome gym owner leads from that conference. That should cover the\\n$150,000 and give us a clean slate.”\\n \\n“Ok, then what? Is this what we’re gonna do?” She looked for\\nsome well-deserved stability .\\n \\n“I mean - I think so? It makes more money than the other thing,\\nand it’ s way easier to deliver .” She agreed. “So after I call those\\nleads, I’ll start running ads. I\\'ll post our success stories in a few\\ngym groups to get leads from there. And I’ll also tell the gyms I’ll\\npay $2000 cash for any gym they send that signs up. That gives us\\nad leads, content leads, and  referral leads.”\\n \\n***\\n \\nIn the next 30 days, we made $215,000 in pr ofit . W e covered the\\n$150,000 in refunds with cash to spare. W e did so well because the\\naverage gym using our advertising system added an extra $30,000\\nin cash in their first 30 days. It made them mor e money than they\\npaid for it . It delivered - in spades . Plus, they got to keep all the\\ncash. They loved it. Referrals poured in.\\n \\nI found the processing records from May-June 2017, the month it\\nall happened:\\n \\nW e finished that first year at $6,820,000 in revenue. The next\\ncalendar year we did $25,900,000 in revenue and $17,000,000 in\\nprofit. Y ea, tens of millions . It was insane. Like, nuts. The\\ncompany continues to this day with 4500+ gym locations and\\ncounting. And no one is more surprised than me. Something I\\nmade actually worked... finally .\\n \\nIn 2018 we started Prestige Labs to sell supplements through our\\ngym client base. W e used Prestige Labs and the gyms as an\\naf filiate network to generate weight loss leads for each other . In\\n2019, we started ALAN. A new type of software company that\\nworked leads for local businesses. In 2020, we founded\\nAcquisition.com as a holding company for our business interests.\\nIn 2021, we sold 75% of ALAN to a bigger company . I’m not\\nallowed to say for how much, but ALAN did $12,000,000 in\\nrevenue in the prior twelve months. So you can use your\\nimagination. W e sold 66% of our supplement and gym licensing\\nbusiness to American Pacific Group at a $46,200,000 valuation.\\nAnd that was after taking $42,000,000 in owner pay over the first 4\\nyears.\\n \\nI share this because I can still hardly believe it. All this was\\nbecause of a girl who believed in me, a credit card, and the ability\\nto get leads.\\n \\n \\nImportant Disclaimer\\n \\nKnowing how to get leads saved my business, my reputation, and\\nlikely my life. It was the only way I stayed afloat. It was the reason\\nI kept getting second, third, fourth, and fifth chances.\\n \\n \\nI advertised a lot of dif ferent things, in a lot of dif ferent ways. I\\nadvertised to get member leads for local gyms. I advertised to get\\nonline weight loss leads for Leila. I advertised to get gym owner\\nleads to sell business services. I advertised to get af filiate leads for\\nour supplement company . I advertised to get agency leads for our\\nsoftware. And so on. Getting leads has been my get out of jail fr ee\\ncard with no expiration date. And at this point, it’ s faded and worn\\nwith use.\\n \\nI’d like to share this skill with you. I can show you how to get\\nmore leads. And here is your first piece of good news: by reading\\nthese words, you’re already in the top 10 percent. Most people buy\\nstuf f and never crack it open. I’ll also throw out a spoiler: the\\nfurther you read, the bigger the nuggets get. Just watch.\\n \\nThank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for allowing\\nme to do work I find meaningful. Thank you for lending me your\\nmost valuable asset—your attention. I promise to do my best to\\ngive you the highest possible return on it. This book delivers.\\n \\nThe world needs more entrepreneurs. It needs more fighters. It\\nneeds more magic. And that’ s what I’m sharing with you ― magic.\\n \\nT h e  P r o b l e m  T h i s  B o o k  S o l v e s\\n“Leads, lots of leads.”\\n \\nY ou have a pr oblem:\\n \\nY ou\\'re not getting as many leads as you want because you\\'re not\\nadvertising enough. Period. As a result, your potential customers\\nare ignorant of your existence. How sad! This means less money\\nflows your way .\\n \\nSo now that you know you have a problem, unless you hate\\nhelping people and making money , you kinda have to solve it.\\n \\nHow this book solves it:\\n \\nT o make more money , you’ve gotta grow your business. Y ou can\\nonly grow your business in two ways: \\n \\n1) Get more customers\\n \\n2) Make them worth more\\n \\nThat’ s it. I grow our portfolio companies with this exact\\nframework. $100M Leads  focuses on number one - getting more\\ncustomers. Y ou get more customers by getting:\\n \\n1) More Leads\\n \\n2) Better Leads\\n \\n3) Cheaper Leads\\n \\n4) Reliably (think ‘from lots of places’).\\n \\n \\nBottom line : All else being equal… when you double your leads,\\nyou double your business .\\n \\nThis book shows you how to transform your business into a lead-\\ngetting machine. Once you apply its models, you instantly  increase\\nlead flow . And, like cash flow , when leads flow , it’ s hard not to\\nmake money . This book will solve your “not getting enough leads”\\nproblem for good.\\n \\nIn a nutshell: I will show you how to get strangers to want  to buy\\nyour stuf f.\\n \\nWhat’ s In It For Me?\\n \\nIn one word: trust .\\n \\nI give this book and the course that comes with it for free (or at\\ncost) in hopes of earning your trust. I want this book to provide\\nmore value than any $1000 course, $30,000 coaching program, or\\n$100,000 degree. Although I could sell these materials that way , I\\ndon’ t want to . I have a dif ferent model. I explain it below .\\n \\nWho am I looking to help?\\n \\nI want to provide value to two types of entrepreneurs. The first is\\nunder  $1,000,000 per year in profit . My goal is to help you get to\\n$1,000,000 in profit per year (fo’ free) and, in so doing, earn your\\ntrust . T ry a couple of tactics from this book, get some leads, then\\ntry a few more, and get more leads. The more leads you get, the\\nbetter .\\n \\nDo it enough, and you become the second type of entrepreneur: the\\ntype making over $1,000,000 in EBITDA (fancy word for profit)\\nper year . Once you get there, or if that’ s you now , it would be my\\nhonor to invest in your business and help you scale.\\n \\nI don\\'t sell coaching, masterminds, courses, or anything like that…\\nI invest. I buy equity in growing, profitable, bootstrapped\\ncompanies . Then, I use the systems, resources, and teams of all my\\ncompanies  to fast-track the growth of your  company .\\n \\nBut don’ t believe me yet... we just met .\\n \\n \\n \\nMy Business Model\\n \\nMy business model is simple:\\n \\n1) Provide better free products than the marketplace’ s paid\\nproducts.\\n \\n2) Earn the trust of entrepreneurs who make over $1,000,000 per\\nyear in profit.\\n \\n3) Invest in those entrepreneurs to fast-track their growth.\\n \\n4) Help everyone else for free, for good.\\n \\nOur process reverse-engineers success. The winners know my\\nmodels will work for them because they already have. And I know\\nthe winners will use them because they already do. So, we operate\\non shared trust.\\n \\nThis approach avoids failures and  increases the likelihood of\\nsuccess. W in-win. Easy to say , but let me show you how much of a\\ndif ference our process makes…\\n \\nW ithin the first 12 months, our average portfolio company 1.8x’ s\\nr evenue and 3.01x’ s pr ofits . And we partner for the long haul,\\nthat\\'s just the first 12 months. Our average portfolio company\\nwho\\'s been with us between 12 and 24 months, 2.3x’ s r evenue and\\n4.7x’ s pr ofits . As a fun exercise, plug your numbers in to see what\\nthat would look like for you. This stuf f works .\\n \\nThat\\'s how I know the models I\\'m about to show you work. They\\nalr eady have .\\n \\n \\nAcquisition.com’ s Mission\\n \\nT o make r eal business accessible to everyone . Businesses solve\\nproblems. Businesses make the world better . There are too many\\nproblems for any one person to solve.\\n \\nAnd I can’ t cure cancer , end hunger , or solve the world’ s ener gy\\ncrisis (for now). But I can provide value to the entrepreneurs who\\nbuild the businesses that will. I want to help create as many\\nbusinesses as possible so we can solve as many problems as we\\ncan. So I share these business-building frameworks rather than\\nhoard them. Fair enough?\\n \\nCool. Let’ s press on.\\n \\n \\nBasic Outline of This Book\\n \\nI laid this book out from zero clients, zero leads, zero advertising,\\nzero money , zero skills (Section II) to max clients, max leads, max\\nadvertising, max money , and max skills (Section IV). W e learn\\nmore skills as we progress in the book. And when we have more\\nskills, we can get mor e leads  in the same amount of time . So, we\\nfinish with the most complex skills that get us the most leads for\\nour time spent. W e save them for the end because they take lots of\\nskills and  money . And, getting good and having money takes time.\\nI want this book to help a person get their first five clients and\\ncrack their first ten million-dollar month and beyond.\\n \\nThis order also reminds those with  skills and money , me included,\\nof the basics we stopped doing. Our businesses deserve better .\\nRespecting the tried-and-true methods that got you to your current\\nlevel will probably get you to the next one. Masters never don’ t do\\nthe basics.\\n \\nSo, we go from getting your first lead all the way to building a\\n$100,000,000+ leads machine. Here’ s the breakdown:\\n \\nSection I:  Y ou’r e about to finish r eading it right now .\\n \\nSection II : I reveal what makes advertising r eally  work. Most\\nentrepreneurs think about advertising the wrong way . Since they\\nthink about advertising the wrong way , they do the wrong stuf f to\\nget leads. Y ou want to do the right stuf f to get leads. This is the\\nway .\\n \\nSection III : W e learn advertising’ s “core four .” There are only four\\nways to get leads. So if there is a most important “how to” section,\\nit’ s this one.\\n \\nSection IV : W e learn how to get other people (customers,\\nemployees, agencies, and af filiates) to do it all for you. And this\\ncompletes the assembly of your fully functioning $100M Leads\\nmachine.\\n \\nSection V : W e wrap up with a one-page advertising plan you can\\nuse to get more leads today .\\n \\n \\n\\nS e c t i o n  I I :  G e t  U n d e r s t a n d i n g\\nAdvertising. Simplified.\\n \\n \\nIn this section, we cover three things to make sure advertising does\\nexactly what we want it to do.\\n \\nFirst, we talk about what a lead actually is. If we want more of\\nthem, then we better be darn well sure we’re talking about the\\nsame thing. Second, we learn how to separate leads that make you\\nmoney from leads that waste your time. Third, I show you the best\\nways I know to get the leads that  make you money to show inter est\\nin the stuff you sell.\\n \\nLet’ s dive in.\\nL e a d s  A l o n e  A r e n ’ t  E n o u g h\\n“If you cannot explain something in simple terms, then you don’ t\\nunderstand it.”\\n- Dr . Richar d Feynman, Nobel Prize W inner in Physics\\n \\n \\nI’ll let you in on a little secret. This book started because\\nsomebody asked me what a lead was. Y ou’d think it would be\\nsimple, but I couldn’ t give a straight answer . And after six months\\nof trying to figure it out,  I was more confused than before. It\\nbecame clear I didn\\'t know as much about leads as I thought . My\\nsearch for a clear  definition of “a lead” snowballed into the\\nmassive project that became $100M Leads. All this to say , we’ve\\ngot to agree on what the heck a lead is before we dive head first\\ninto getting them...\\n \\nSo what’ s a lead anyways?\\n \\nSomeone who clicks an ad?\\n \\nA phone number?\\n \\nA person that schedules a call?\\n \\nA list of names?\\n \\nA door you knock on?\\n \\nA walk-in?\\n \\nAn email address?\\n \\nA subscriber?\\n \\nA person that sees your content?\\n \\nEtc…\\n \\nY ou see, words matter because they af fect how we think. How we\\nthink af fects what we do. And if words have us thinking the wrong\\nway , then we will probably do the wrong stuf f. I hate doing the\\nwrong stuf f. So to do the right stuf f more and the wrong stuf f less,\\nit’ s best we know what words mean and use them.\\n \\nT o cut the suspense, a lead  is a person you can contact . That’ s all.\\nIf you bought a list of emails, those are leads. If you get contact\\ninformation from a website or database, those are leads. The\\nnumbers in your phone are leads. People on the street are leads. If\\nyou can contact them, they ar e leads.\\n \\nBut what I came to realize was - leads alone ar en’ t enough . W e\\nwant  engaged  leads:  people who *show* inter est in the stuff you\\nsell . If someone gives  their contact information on a website, that\\nis an engaged lead. If someone follows  you on social media and\\nyou can contact them, that is an engaged lead. If people r eply  to\\nyour email campaign, they are engaged leads. The leads showing\\ninter est  are the leads that matter .\\n \\nEngaged leads are the true output of advertising.\\n \\nGetting more engaged  leads is the point of this book. But I\\ncouldn’ t call the book “engaged leads” because no one would get\\nit. But now you do. So the next question is: How do we get leads to\\nengage?\\nE n g a g e  Y o u r  L e a d s :  O f f e r s  a n d  L e a d  M a g n e t s\\n“I don’ t do drugs. I am drugs” - Salvador Dali\\n \\n \\nApril 2016.\\n \\nI paid $25,000 to be in this group, and everyone  told me to do a\\nwebinar . In fact, my mentor at the time told me, “Do a webinar\\nevery week until you make a million dollars. Until then, don’ t ask\\nme about anything else.” This is my only path to success.  I’ve got\\nto figur e this out.\\n \\nA webinar , as I understood it, was a magical presentation with a\\nzillion slides. If somebody watched, it would hypnotize them into\\nbuying my thing.\\n \\nThere was so much I didn\\'t know . Landing pages. Registration\\npages. Follow-up emails. Replay emails. Cart close emails.\\nPresentation software. W ebsite integration. W riting ads. Making ad\\ncreative. Figuring out where to put the ads. Who to show the ads\\nto. Building a payment page. Processing payments. Never mind\\nmaking the actual webinar . The list overwhelmed me.\\n \\nSo, I started with what I understood most, the landing page. I built\\na few of those for my gyms. My mentor made millions with\\nwebinars, so I modeled his landing page. But I didn’ t need it to\\nmake millions. I just needed it to make something .\\n \\nOkay ...now the “thank you” page.\\n \\nAn entire Sunday later , the “thank you” page went live. Now for\\nthe big test.  I put my email into the landing page, clicked “sign me\\nup,” and waited. My brand new thank you page loaded. Success. I\\nstill wasn’ t a millionaire, sad face. But it was something.\\n \\nThe following Sunday , I sat down for my regular ‘work on  the\\nbusiness, not in  the business’ ritual. I had ten hours to figure out\\nthe next piece of this webinar puzzle. After my first cup of cof fee, I\\ndecided I didn’ t really want to work, but I still wanted to feel\\nproductive. So I went to my advertising group’ s forum to get some\\ntips.\\n \\n“Just got off my webinar . $32k in an hour! I ROI’d the entir e\\ntuition in my first week! W ebinars r ock!”\\n \\nI’m never gonna make this work . He joined the same month as me.\\nHe was in the same industry as me. He figured out how to make\\nmoney with his webinar before me. He was stealing all the clients\\nbefore I even got a chance. Everyone is making money except me.\\n \\nDesperate, I called other people in the group. “I will do anything\\nfor your business: build a sales team… write your sales scripts…\\nfix your sales process… anything… just help me finish this\\nwebinar …please?” One person agreed to help me. Thank God.\\n \\nEight Sundays later , and the little circle next to my ad campaign\\nturned green. It’ s alive! I was of ficially spending $150 per day on\\nads. All I had to do now was watch the money pour in. I was gonna\\nbe rich!\\n \\nThr ee days, $450, 80 leads, and 0 sales later…\\n \\nI shut it all down. I suck.\\n \\nNo one even watched my webinar . Meanwhile, that guy posted\\nagain  about how much money he was making of f this webinar\\nstuf f. Why do I suck so much?\\n \\nI spent most of my money to join this group, and I just set another\\n$450 on fire. I didn’ t have the money to fail again. I needed  the\\nnext thing to work. And if I couldn’ t even get anyone to watch,\\nwhat was the point?\\n \\n \\nThe case study:\\n \\nI scrolled my newsfeed to see what other people were doing. An ad\\ncaught my eye. “Free Case Study on How I Spent $1 and Made\\n$123,000 in a W eekend” or something like that. I punched in my\\nemail, and the page sent me to a video of walking through a\\nsuccessful advertising campaign. Nothing fancy . No slides. No\\n“presenting.” Just a dude explaining how his stuf f worked.\\n \\nThis, I can do.\\n \\nI fired up my screen recorder:\\n \\nOkay everyone. So her e’ s the ad account of a gym we just\\nlaunched. Her e ar e the ads we ran. This is how much we spent. W e\\nsent them to this page with this offer . Y ou can see how many leads\\nwe got her e. They got this many people scheduled. This many\\nshowed. This is how many they sold. This is how much the gym\\nowner made. This is everything we did. If you want help setting\\nsomething like this up, we’ll do the whole thing for fr ee. And we\\nonly get paid off the sales you make. If that sounds fair , book a\\ncall.\\n \\nIt took maybe 13 minutes. Simple. I swapped the webinar out for\\nthis video and changed the headline:\\n \\n“FREE Case Study: How we added 213 members and $1 12,000 in\\nrevenue to a small gym in San Diego.”\\n \\nThey would book a call on the next page.\\n \\nI set up a fresh ad campaign and went to bed.\\n \\n \\nThe next morning…\\n \\n“Alex…what did you do?” Leila asked.\\n \\n“What do you mean?”\\n \\n“Strangers have booked my calendar solid for like the next week.”\\n \\n“Really?”\\n \\n“Y ea. Did you start a new campaign or something?”\\n \\n“Y ea… but I didn’ t think it would go live so fast. W ait. People\\nbooked calls!?”\\n \\n“Y ea. T ons.”\\n \\nSeeing Leila’ s calendar stacked with appointments filled me with\\njoy . It’ s working!\\n \\nI learned an important lesson. They didn\\'t want my webinar . But\\nthey did want my case study . This accidental discovery showed me\\nhow getting leads actually works…you have to give people\\nsomething they want. The best part is - it’ s easier than you think.\\n \\n \\nLead Magnets Get Leads to Engage\\n \\nOffers  are what you promise to give in exchange for something of\\nvalue. Often, a business promises to give its product or service in\\nexchange for money . This is a cor e offer . If you advertise your core\\nof fer , then you go straight for the sale–the direct path to money .\\nAdvertising your core of fer might be all you need to get leads to\\nengage. T ry this way first.\\n \\n \\nSometimes, though, people want to know more about your of fer\\nbefore they buy . This is common for businesses that sell more\\nexpensive stuf f. If that’ s you, then you’ll often get more leads to\\nengage by advertising with a lead magnet first. A lead magnet  is a\\ncomplete solution to a narrow problem . It’ s typically  a lower -cost\\nor free of fer to see who is interested in your stuf f. And, once\\nsolved, it reveals another problem solved by your cor e offer . This is\\nimportant because leads interested in lower -cost or free of fers now\\nare more likely to buy a related higher -cost of fer later .\\n \\nThink of it like salty pretzels at a bar . If somebody eats the\\npretzels, they’ll get thirsty and order a drink. The salty pretzels\\nsolve the narrow problem of hunger . They also reveal a thirst\\nproblem solved by a drink, which they can get, in exchange for\\nmoney . The pretzels have a cost, but when done right, the drink\\nrevenue covers the cost of the pretzels and  nets a profit.\\n \\nSo your lead magnet should be valuable enough on its own that\\nyou could  char ge for it. And, after they get it, they should want\\nmor e  of what you of fer . This gets them one step closer to buying\\nyour stuf f. A person who pays with their time now is mor e likely to\\npay with their money later .\\n \\nGood lead magnets get more engaged leads and customers than a\\ncore of fer alone, and do it for less money . So let’ s make a lead\\nmagnet, shall we?\\n \\n \\n \\nSeven Steps T o Cr eating an Effective Lead Magnet\\n \\nStep 1: Figure out the problem you want to solve and who to solve it\\nfor\\n \\nStep 2: Figure out how to solve it\\n \\nStep 3: Figure out how to deliver it\\n \\nStep 4: T est what to name it\\n \\nStep 5: Make it easy to consume\\n \\nStep 6: Make it darn good\\n \\nStep 7: Make it easy for them to tell you they want more\\n \\n \\nSomething to keep in mind befor e we start - Grand Slam Of fers\\nwork for free stuf f as much or better than they do for paid stuf f. So\\nmake your lead magnet so insanely good people will feel stupid\\nsaying no. And yes, this means you may have a few insanely\\nvaluable of fers (even if some are free). But that’ s a good  thing. The\\nbusiness that provides the most value wins. Period. So let’ s get\\nstarted.\\n \\n \\nStep 1: Figur e out the pr oblem you want to solve and who to\\nsolve it for\\n \\nHere’ s a simple example we can walk through together…this book\\nis a lead magnet. Y ou are a lead. I want to solve an engaged lead\\nproblem. And I want to solve it for businesses making less than\\n$1,000,000 in annual profit. W ith enough engaged leads, they can\\nmake mor e than  $1,000,000+ in annual profit. Then, they qualify\\nfor my core of fer: me investing in their company to help them\\nscale.\\n \\nThe first step is picking the problem to solve. I use a simple model\\nto figure this out. I call it the Problem-Solution cycle. Y ou can see\\nit below .\\n \\n \\nEvery problem has a solution. Every solution reveals more\\nproblems. This is the never -ending cycle of business (and life).\\nAnd, smaller problem-solution cycles sit inside lar ger problem-\\nsolution cycles. So how do we pick the right problem to solve?\\n \\nW e start by picking a problem that’ s narrow and  meaningful. Then,\\nsolve it. And, like we just learned, when we solve one problem, a\\nnew problem reveals itself. Here comes the important part- if we\\ncan solve that new pr oblem with our cor e offer , we’ve got a winner .\\nThis is because we solve this new problem in exchange for money .\\nThat’ s it. Don’ t overthink it.\\n \\nExample : Imagine we help homeowners sell their homes. That is a\\nbr oad  solution. But what about the steps befor e  selling a home?\\nOwners want to know what their house is worth. They want to\\nknow how to increase its value. They need pictures. They need it\\ncleaned. They need landscaping. They need minor things fixed.\\nThey need moving services. They may need staging. Etc. These are\\nall narr ow  problems–great for lead magnets. W e pick one of the\\nnarrow problems and solve it for free. And although it helps, it\\nmakes their other problem more obvious– they still have to sell\\ntheir home.  But now we’ve earned their trust. So we can char ge to\\nsolve the remaining problems with our core of fer and help them\\nachieve their broader goal.\\n \\nAction Step : Pick the narrowly defined problem you want to solve.\\nThen, make sure your core of fer can solve the next problem that\\ncomes up.\\n \\n \\nStep 2: Figur e out how to solve it\\n \\nThere are three types of lead magnets and each of fers a dif ferent\\ntype of solution.\\n \\nFirst, if your audience has a problem they don’ t know about, your\\nlead magnet would make them aware of it. Second, you could\\nsolve a recurring problem for a short amount of time with a sample\\nor trial of your core of fer . Third, you can give them one step in a\\nmulti-step process that solves a bigger problem. All three solve one\\nproblem and reveal others. So your three types are: 1) Reveal\\nProblems, 2) Samples and T rials, and 3) One Step Of A Multi-Step\\nProcess.\\n \\n \\n1)  Reveal Their Pr oblem . Think “diagnosis.” These lead magnets\\nwork great when they reveal problems that get worse the longer\\nyou wait .\\n \\n○    Example: Y ou run a speed test that shows their website loads\\nat 30% below the speed it should. Y ou draw a clear line\\nbetween where they should be and how much money they\\nlose by being below standards. \\n \\n○    Example: Y ou do a posture analysis and show them what their\\nposture should look like. Y ou draw a clear line to what their\\npain-free life would look like if their posture were fixed and\\nhow you can help.\\n \\n○    Example: Y ou do a termite inspection that reveals what\\nhappens when the bugs eat their home. If they do have\\ntermites, you can get rid of them for cheaper than the cost\\nof… another home. If they don’ t, they can pay you to prevent\\nthe termites from coming to begin with! Y ou can sell ‘em\\neither way . W in-win!\\n \\n2)  Samples And T rials . Y ou give full but brief access to your core\\nof fer . Y ou can limit the number of uses, time they have access, or\\nboth. This works great when your core of fer is a recurring solution\\nto a recurring problem. \\n \\n○    Example: Y ou hook them up to your faster server and show\\ntheir website loading at lightning speed. They get more\\ncustomers from your faster load times. If they want to keep it,\\nthey need to keep paying you. \\n \\n○    Example: Y ou give a free adjustment for their bad posture and\\nthey experience relief. T o get permanent benefits, they must\\nbuy more. \\n \\n○    Example: Food, cosmetics, medicine, or any other\\nconsumable s. Consumables, by nature, have limited uses and\\nsolve recurring problems... with recurring use. So single\\nserving, “fun sized,” etc. samples are great lead magnets. It’ s\\nhow Costco sells more food than other stores–they give out\\nsamples!\\n \\n \\n3)  One Step Of A Multi-Step Pr ocess . When your core of fer has\\nsteps, you can give one valuable step for free and the rest when\\nthey buy . This works great when your core of fer solves a more\\ncomplex problem.\\n \\n○    Example: This book. I help you get to $1,000,000+ per year\\nin profit. Then you’ll have new problems we can help you\\nsolve, and scale from there. \\n \\n○    Example: Y ou give away a free wood sealant for a garage\\ndoor . But the sealing process requires three dif ferent coats to\\nprotect from all weather conditions. I do the first one free,\\nexplain how it only gives partial coverage, and of fer the other\\ntwo in a bundle. \\n \\n○    Example: Y ou give away free finance courses, guides,\\ncalculators, templates, etc. They are so valuable people really\\ncan do it all themselves. But, they also reveal the time, ef fort,\\nand sacrifice of doing it all. So you of fer financial services to\\nsolve all that.\\n \\nAction Step : Pick how you want to solve your narrowly defined\\nproblem.\\n \\n \\n \\nStep 3: Figur e out how to deliver it\\n \\n \\nThere are unlimited ways to solve problems. But my favorite lead\\nmagnets solve them with: software, information, services, and\\nphysical products. And each of those works great with the three\\ntypes of lead magnets from step two. I’ll show you what I’ve done\\nto attract gym owners using each lead magnet type.\\n \\n1)  Software : Y ou give them a tool . If you have a spreadsheet,\\ncalculator , or small software, your technology does a job for them. \\n \\nEx: I give away a spreadsheet or dashboard that gives a gym owner\\nall their relevant business stats, compares them to industry\\naverages, then gives them a rank. \\n \\n2)  Information : Y ou teach them something . Courses, lessons,\\ninterviews with experts, keynote presentations, live events,\\nmistakes and pitfalls, hacks/tips, etc. Anything they can learn  from.\\n \\nEx: I give away a mini course for gyms on how to write an ad. \\n \\n3)  Services : Y ou do work for fr ee . Adjust their back. Perform a website\\naudit. Apply the first layer of garage sealant. T ransform their video\\ninto an ebook. Etc. \\n \\nEx: I run gym owner ’ s ads for free for thirty days. \\n \\n4)  Physical Products : Y ou give them something they can hold in their\\nhands . A posture assessment chart, a supplement, a small bottle of\\ngarage door sealant, boxing gloves to get boxing gym leads, etc.\\n \\nEx: I sell a book for gym owners called Gym Launch Secr ets .\\n \\nW ith three dif ferent types of lead magnets and four ways to deliver\\nthem, that\\'s up to twelve lead magnets that solve a single narrow\\nproblem. So many magnets, so little time!\\n \\nI make as many versions of a lead magnet as I can and rotate them.\\nThis keeps the advertising fresh and  low ef fort. Plus, you see\\nwhich ones work best. Like my case study story at the beginning of\\nthe chapter , the results are often surprising. And you won’ t know\\nuntil you try .\\n \\nAction Step : As a thought exercise, think of a lead magnet and\\nthen a version of it for each delivery method. Y ou always can, I\\npromise. Then, pick how to deliver your  lead magnet.\\n \\n \\nStep 4: T est What T o Name It\\n \\n \\nDavid Ogilvy said, “When you have written your headline, you\\nhave spent 80 cents of your (advertising) dollar .” What that means\\nis, five times more people read your headline than any other part of\\nyour promotion. They read it and make a snap decision to read\\nfurther… or not. Like Ogilvy hints, leads have to notice your lead\\nmagnet befor e  they can consume it. Like it or not, this means how\\nwe present it matters more than anything. For example, improving\\nthe headline, name, and display of your lead magnet can 2x, 3x, or\\n10x your engagement. It’ s that  important. Besides, if no one shows\\ninterest in your lead magnet, no one will ever know how good it is.\\nY ou can’ t leave it to chance. So listen up. Here’ s what you do next\\n- you test .\\n \\nThe three things you’ll want to test are the headline, the image(s),\\nand the subheadline, in that order . The headline is the most\\nimportant. So if you only test one thing, test that. For example, I\\nhad no idea what to title this book. So here’ s what I did to figure\\nout which name would do the best -  I tested . The results may\\nsurprise you as much as they surprised me.\\n \\nHeadline T ests\\n \\nRound I:  Advertising  ✔  vs. Promotion\\n \\nRound II:  Advertising vs. Leads  ✔\\n \\nRound III:  Marketing vs. Leads  ✔\\n \\nImage T est\\n \\n✔  Real vs. Cartoon\\n \\n \\nSubheadlines\\n \\nRound I:\\n“How to get more people to want to buy your stuf f”\\n“How to get strangers to want to buy your stuf f”  ✔\\n \\nRound II:\\nHow to get more strangers to want to buy your stuf f”\\n“How to get strangers to want to buy your stuf f”  ✔\\n \\nRound III:\\n“How to get as many leads as you darn well please”\\n“How to get strangers to want to buy your stuf f ” ✔\\n \\nRound IV :\\n“Get strangers to want to buy your stuf f”\\n“How to get strangers to want to buy your stuf f ” ✔\\n \\nNote two things with the subheadline tests:\\n \\n1) “How to get strangers to want to buy your stuf f” overwhelmingly\\nbeat “Get strangers to want to buy your stuf f.” The only dif ference is\\ntwo little words: “how to.” And it also beat “how to get mor e\\nstrangers to want to buy your stuf f” with a single word removed\\n‘ mor e. ’ Small changes can make big dif ferences. \\n \\n2) Since so many people asked, I figured I’d answer it here. I didn’ t\\nsubtitle the book “How to get strangers to buy your stuf f” because\\nthat’ s sales, not getting leads. The point of this book is to get\\nstrangers to show interest, not to buy (yet). A raised hand is where\\nthis book ends. ‘$100M Sales’ or  \\'Persuasion\\' (I haven\\'t decided yet)\\nwill be a future book. One problem at a time.\\n \\nAction Step : T est. If people engage in droves, you’ve got a winner .\\n \\nAnd if you have any following at all, you can run polls like these.\\nY ou don\\'t need a lot of votes to get a directional idea. If you can’ t\\ndo that, make a post on every platform and ask people to respond\\nwith a ‘1’ or a ‘2’, then count ‘em up. If you still can’ t even do\\nthat, then just message people and ask. There’ s always a way , and\\nthis is one of the highest leverage things you can do with your time\\n- make sure how you package it gets engagement and you give\\nyourself a big head start.\\n \\nBonus Points: If people respond to the poll and  ask when they can\\nget their hands on it, you have a mega winner .\\n \\n \\nStep 5: Make it easy for them to consume\\n \\n \\nPeople prefer to do things that take less ef fort. So if we want more\\npeople to take us up on our lead magnet, and consume it, we gotta\\nmake it easy . Y ou can see 2x, 3x, and even 4x+ increases in take\\nrates and  consumption simply by making it easier to consume.\\n \\n1)  Software : Y ou want to make it accessible on their phones, on a\\ncomputer and in multiple dif ferent formats. This way , they’ll pick\\nthe one easiest for them. \\n \\n2)  Information : People like to consume things in dif ferent ways. Some\\npeople like watching, other people like reading, others like\\nlistening, etc. Make your solution in as many dif ferent formats as\\nyou can: images, video, text, audio, etc. Of fer them all. That’ s why\\nthis book comes in every format people consume. \\n \\n3)  Services : Be available at more times in more ways. More times of\\nday . More days of the week. V ia video call, phone call, in person,\\netc. The easier you are to get a hold of, the more likely people will\\nbecome engaged leads to claim the free value. \\n \\n4)  Physical products : Make it super simple to order and fast to get to\\nthem. Make the product itself fast and easy to open. Give simple\\ndirections on how to use the product. Example : Apple made its\\nproducts so well they didn’ t even need directions. And the\\npackaging is so good, most people keep the boxes.\\n \\nAction Step : Package your lead magnet in every way you can. It\\ndramatically increases how many engaged leads come your way .\\nAnd more leads engaging with your lead magnet means more leads\\ngetting value from it. This is huge.\\n \\nFun fact: My book $100M Offers has a near perfect ¼, ¼, ¼, ¼\\nsplit between ebooks, physical books, audiobooks, and videos (free\\non Acquisition.com). Making the book available in multiple\\nformats is the easiest way I know to get 2-3-4x the amount of leads\\nfor the same work. If I only made it available in one format, I’d\\nmiss out on the 3-4x the people who wouldn’ t have read the book\\notherwise. What a shame that would’ve been and what a waste.\\n \\n \\nStep 6: Make it darn good:\\n \\nGive A way The Secr ets, Sell The Implementation\\n \\nThe marketplace judges everything you have to of fer - fr ee or not .\\nAnd you can never provide too much value. But, you can provide\\ntoo little. So you want your lead magnet to provide so much value\\npeople feel obligated to pay you. The goal is to provide more value\\nthan the cost of your core of fer  befor e they’ve bought it.\\n \\nThink about it this way . If you’re scared of giving away your\\nsecrets, imagine the alternative: Y ou give away sucky fluf f. Then,\\npeople who might\\'ve become customers think this person sucks!\\nThey only have sucky fluff! Then, they buy from someone else. So\\nsad. Not only that, they tell other folks who might’ve bought from\\nyou, not to. It’ s a vicious cycle you don’ t want to ride.\\n \\nBut remember , people buy stuf f based on how much value they\\nthink they’ll get  after  they buy it. And the easiest way to get them\\nto think they’ll get tons of value after they buy is… drum roll\\nplease… to provide them with value befor e  they buy .\\n \\nImagine a company scaled from $1M to $10M just by consuming\\nmy free content. The chance they’ll partner with Acquisition.com\\nis huge because I paid for my shar e befor e we even started .\\n \\nAction Step : 99% of people aren’ t gonna buy , but they will create\\n(or destroy) your reputation based on the value of your free stuf f. \\nSo, make your lead magnets as good as your paid stuf f. Y our\\nreputation depends on it. Provide value. Stack the deck. Reap the\\nrewards.\\n \\n \\nStep 7: Make it easy for them to tell you they want mor e\\n \\nOnce the leads consume the lead magnet, some of them will be\\nready to buy or learn more about your of fer . This is the time to give\\na Call T o Action. A  Call T o Action (CT A)  tells the audience what\\nto do next. But, there’ s a little more to it than that. At least, if you\\nwant your advertising to work. Good CT As have two things: 1)\\nwhat to do and 2) reasons to do it right now .\\n \\nWhat to do : CT As tell the audience to call the number , click the\\nbutton, give information, book the call, etc. There are way too\\nmany to list. Just know CT As tell the audience how to become\\nengaged leads. Good CT As have clear , simple, and direct  language.\\nNot “ don’ t delay ” but instead “ call now .” Read the next paragraph\\nto learn more (see what I did there?).\\n \\nReasons to do it right now  - If you give people a reason to take\\naction, more people will do it. But a couple things to keep in mind:\\nfirst, good reasons work better than bad reasons. And second, any\\nreason (even bad ones) tends to work better than no reason at all.\\nSo to get more people to take action, I include as many ef fective\\nreasons as I can. Here are my favorite reasons to act now:  \\n \\na) Scar city -  Scarcity  is when ther e is a limited amount of something.\\nEspecially when there is a small supply  compared to demand .  When\\nsomething is scarce, like your lead magnet or of fer , people also tend\\nto want it more. And this is why they’re more likely to act right now .\\nThe fewer you have, the more valuable people think it is. But there’ s a\\ncatch- the fewer you have, the fewer engaged leads you can get before\\nrunning out. So the best strategy I know for scarcity is - r eality .  Let\\nme explain. If you sold 1000x the customers tomorrow , could you\\nhandle it? If not, you have some  limit to how much you can sell.\\nMaybe you’re limited by customer service, onboarding, inventory ,\\ntime slots per week, etc. Don’ t keep it a secret - advertise it. This\\ngives you ethical  scarcity . If you can’ t handle more than five new\\ncustomers per week, say so . Draw attention to the natural scarcity in\\nyour business. If you have limitations you may as well use them to\\nmake money .\\n \\nEx:  “The most convenient class times fill up fast. Call now to get the\\none you want.”\\n \\n“I can only handle five people per week, so if you want it solved\\nsoon, do xyz…”\\n \\n“W e only printed one batch of shirts and will never r eprint this\\ndesign, get one so you don’ t r egr et missing out for ever…”\\n \\nb) Urgency . Y ou can have unlimited units to sell, but let’ s say you stop\\nselling them in an hour… on purpose . I bet more people than normal\\nwill buy your thing in that hour . This is ur gency in action. Urgency is\\nwhen people act faster because they have a short amount of time. \\nAnd the less time people have, the faster (more ur gent) they tend to\\nact. So if you make the time they can act on your CT A shorter , you\\ncan get mor e  of them to act on it faster .  Y ou can also use the same\\nur gency with discounts or bonuses that go away after X minutes or\\nhours. After which, this of fer will never be available again. \\n \\nEx:  “Our July 4th pr omotion ends Monday at midnight, so if you want\\nit, take action now .”\\n \\n“Our Black Friday pr omotion ends at midnight. Ther e ar e only\\nfour hours left. Get it while the gettin’ s good.”\\n \\n“Thr ough Friday , I’ll also thr ow in a fr ee hat to anyone who buys\\nmor e than thr ee books. So if you wanna look slick in an\\nAcquisition.com hat, buy now .”\\n \\n \\n \\nc) Fraternity Party Planner (my favorite) - Make Up A Reason .\\nFraternities don’ t need a reason to party - but they sure make up some\\ndoozies. “John got his wisdom teeth removed…kegger!” “Mar gherita\\nMonday!” “T oga T uesdays” “Thirsty Thursday!” etc. Y our reason\\ndoesn’ t even have to make sense, and it will still  get more people to\\nact.  In fact, Harvard ran an experiment showing that people were\\nmore likely to let someone cut in line if they only gave a r eason . The\\nnumber of people that let others cut incr eased  if the reason made\\nsense (like scarcity and ur gency). But any r eason  still works better\\nthan no r eason . So I always try to include one. Think ‘the stuf f you\\nsay’ after the word because . Examples:\\n \\n●    Because… moms know best.\\n \\n●    Because… your country needs you.\\n \\n●    Because… it’ s my birthday , and I want you to celebrate with me.\\n \\nAction Step:  Give a clear , simple, action-oriented CT A. Then, give\\nthem a ‘reason why’ using scarcity , ur gency , and any other reasons\\nyou can think of. And, do it often. Don\\'t be clever , be clear .\\n \\nEven if your lead magnet costs money to deliver , it should still\\nlower  your cost to get a new customer . This is because more\\nengaged leads means more chances to get customers. And the extra\\ncustomers mor e than  cover your costs. That’ s the point.\\n \\nLet’ s say you make $10,000 of profit on your core of fer . And it\\ncosts you $1000 in advertising to get someone on a call for it. If\\nyou close one out of three people, it costs you $3000 in advertising\\nto get a customer . Since we have $10,000 in profit to work with,\\nthat’ s fine. But we’re savvy , we can do better . So, let’ s do better .\\n \\nImagine you advertise a free lead magnet instead of your core\\nof fer . Y our lead magnet costs you $25 to deliver , and because it’ s\\nfree to them, more will engage. The extra engagement means it\\nonly costs $75 in advertising to get someone on a call. All in, it’ s\\n$100 per call. By delivering value before they buy , you get ten\\ntimes mor e engaged leads for the same cost. Note : this happens all\\nthe time when you nail the lead magnet.\\n \\nNow , let’ s say one out of ten folks who get the lead magnet buys\\nyour core of fer . This means your new cost to acquire a customer is\\n$1000 ($100 x 10 people). W e just cut our cost to get a customer\\nby 3x. So instead of spending $3000 to get a new customer , by\\nusing a lead magnet, we spend only $1000. Given we make\\n$10,000, that’ s a 10:1 return. So if we keep our advertising budget\\nthe same, and use a lead magnet, we triple our business .\\nRemember: the goal is to print money , not just make our “fair\\nshare.”\\n \\nThis is where experienced business owners beat newbies. W ith a\\n$25 budget to deliver your lead magnet, you can provide F AR\\nmore value than a $0 budget. Crazy , I know . Y ou attract more\\ncustomers because your lead magnet is more valuable than other\\npeople’ s. Oftentimes, by a lot. This translates into more strangers\\nbecoming engaged leads. It also translates into more sales because\\nyou provided value in advance. W in. W in.

In\\nthe first chapter , we covered why leads alone aren’ t enough–you\\nneed engaged leads . In the second chapter , we covered how to get\\nleads to engage - a valuable lead magnet or offer . And a good lead\\nmagnet does four things:\\n \\n1)  Engages ideal customers when they see it. \\n \\n2)  Gets more people to engage than your core of fer alone\\n \\n3)  Is valuable enough that they consume it. \\n \\n4)  Makes the right people more likely to buy \\n \\nSo, more people show interest in our stuf f. W e make more money\\nfrom them. And we deliver more value than we ever have–all at\\nthe same time.\\n \\n \\nNext Up:\\n \\nW e’ve armed ourselves with a powerful lead magnet. Now , I’ll\\nshow you the four ways we can advertise it. In other words, now\\nthat we have “the stuf f,”–we gotta tell people about it. Let’ s get\\nsome leads.\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nS e c t i o n  I I I :  G e t  L e a d s\\nThe Cor e Four Advertising Methods.\\n \\n \\nW e get engaged leads by letting people know about our stuf f. And\\nthere are two types of people we let know: people who know us\\nand people who don’ t. And there are two paths of letting them\\nknow about it: one-to-one and one-to-many . Those combine into\\nthe four basic ways one person can let other people know about\\nanything. Let’ s break down how we can use those four ways to get\\nus leads.\\n \\n \\nT wo T ypes of Audiences: W arm and Cold\\n \\nW arm audiences  are people who gave you permission to contact\\nthem.  Think “people who know you” - aka - friends, family ,\\nfollowers, current customers, previous customers, contacts, etc.\\n \\nCold audiences  are people who have not given you permission to\\ncontact them . Think “strangers” - aka - other peoples’ audiences:\\nbuying contact lists, making contact lists, paying platforms for\\naccess, etc.\\n \\nThe dif ference matters because it changes how  we advertise to\\nthem.\\n \\n \\nT wo W ays T o Communicate: One to One (Private), One to\\nMany (Public)\\n \\n \\nW e can contact people 1-to-1 or 1-to-many . Another way of\\nthinking about this is private or public communication. Private\\ncommunication is when only one person gets a message at a time.\\nThink “phone call” or “email.” If you announce something\\npublicly , many people can get it at the same time. Think “social\\nmedia posts” or “billboards” or “podcasts.”\\n \\nNow , automation can make this seem  confusing. Don’ t let it.\\nAutomation just means some of the work is done by machines. The\\nnature of the communication stays the same. Email, for instance, is\\none-to-one. Emailing a 10,000 person list “once” is more like one-\\nto-one r eally fast  by a machine. Automation, which we cover later ,\\nis one of the many ways we can get leads on steroids. Like\\naudiences, the dif ference between public and private\\ncommunication matters because they change how  we advertise.\\n \\n \\nSection III Outline: Get Leads\\n \\n \\nCombining warm and cold audiences with 1-to-1 and 1-to-many\\nleads us to the only four ways we can let anyone know about\\nanything: the core four . I combined them below for you.\\n \\n1-to-1 to a W arm Audience = W arm Outreach \\n \\n1-to-many to a W arm Audience = Posting Content \\n \\n1-to-1 to a Cold Audience = Cold Outreach\\n \\n1-to-many to a Cold Audience = Paid Ads\\n \\nThese are the only  four things you can do  to let other people know\\nabout the stuf f you sell.  And each method takes us one step closer\\nto the land of overflowing leads. I refer to the core four throughout\\nthe rest of the book - so get to know them. In fact, make them part\\nof yourself.\\n \\nOnce you do, you will have your own “get out of jail free” card to\\ncarry around forever . It will give you as many chances to succeed\\nat business as you could ever want for the r est of your life . Or at\\nleast, it has for me.\\n \\nSo if you aren’ t getting as many leads as you want, you’re not\\ndoing the core four with enough skill or with enough volume. W e\\ncover all this stuf f in lots of detail. How they work. How to do\\nthem. When to do them. And show how to measure your progress\\nalong the way . This simplifies the overly confused world of\\nadvertising into four core actions . Either do them and get as many\\nleads as you darn well please, or get crushed by those who do.\\n \\n \\n\\n# 1  W a r m  O u t r e a c h\\nHow T o Reach Out T o People Y ou Know\\n“The world belongs to those who can keep doing without seeing\\nthe r esult of their doing.”\\n \\n \\nMay 2013. Starting out.\\n \\nFor the third time that day , I pulled out my phone and checked my\\nbank account. $51,128.13 . I let out a small sigh of relief. It’ s\\namazing how years of work and saving can fit into such a tiny\\nscreen. Feeling good for the moment, I switched over to social\\nmedia to get more dopamine. Friends from college were applying\\nto business school. Acceptance letters filled my newsfeed. I, too,\\nstarted the business school application process.\\n \\nI had a choice: I could either quit my job and go to business\\nschool, or I could quit my job and start a business.\\n \\nThe application stared at me - How will a Harvar d MBA help your\\nshort and long-term goals?\\n \\nThat question changed my life. I spent three days trying to answer\\nit. At the end of the third day , I saw the truth - it wouldn’ t .\\n$150,000 in loans and two years without income wouldn’ t help me\\nstart a business. At least not as much as starting a business and\\ntaking two years to figure it out. I could make the same amount by\\nthe time I graduate and skip the debt . Or at least, that’ s what I told\\nmyself.\\n \\nSo I quit my job and took the steps to start my business. I set up\\nImpetus Group LLC. Check. I set up a business banking account.\\nCheck. I set up a merchant account to process payments. Check.\\nThere still wasn’ t any money coming in, but at least I felt ‘legit.’\\n \\nImpetus Gr oup LLC. (say it out loud...)\\n \\nThe first person I told about my new business said, “Impotence?”\\nGod, I suck. No wonder the name was available . I immediately\\nchanged it to ‘The Free T raining Project.’ Name that doesn’ t suck?\\nCheck. I was in business.\\n \\nBut I had a problem - I didn’ t know anything about advertising or\\nsales. But I did know I needed clients. So, I just asked around\\nwhere I could. I called, texted, and sent Facebook messages to a\\nbunch of people I knew .\\n \\n“Hey , do you know anyone who’ s trying to get into shape? I\\'m\\ntraining people for fr ee for twelve weeks. On top of that, I\\'ll make\\nthem a custom nutrition plan and gr ocery list. All they have to do\\nis donate to a charity of their choice and let me use their\\ntestimonial.”\\n \\nOnly six people said yes. Six. T wo high school friends. One\\ncollege friend. And three people they referred.\\n \\nI emailed everyone fitness plans and we got to work. W e texted\\nduring the week to keep tabs on progress. Thankfully , they were all\\nfriends of mine, so they gave it their all. They encouraged me more\\nthan anyone in the beginning. A decade later , I still have their\\nbefore and after pictures.\\n \\n \\nAnd this is where the decision to skip business school started\\ncoming back to haunt me. A few months into this, I was less sure\\nof myself. My ‘pile’ of money didn’ t look as big without new\\nmoney coming in every month. And it started turning into a real\\nproblem. So, after twelve weeks of the “pay a charity period,” I\\nasked them to pay me instead. I was the charity now . Ha. I worried\\nthey’d be upset to pay me instead, but they didn’ t seem to mind.\\n \\nOnce they got results, I asked them to send their friends over . T o\\nmy surprise, I got another five or six clients from their referrals. I\\nasked the referrals to pay me directly . Again, none of them minded.\\nThat little business made about $4000 per month and replaced the\\nincome from my first job. It gave me enough money to live on (and\\nsome). My savings started to grow again. Sigh of relief.\\n \\nIf this business sounds straightforward, that’ s because it was. I\\nemailed clients their plans and they texted me the questions they\\nhad along the way . That’ s about it.\\n \\nSo if you’re starting, you don’ t need a lot. All you need is a tax ID,\\na bank account, a way to take payments, and a way to\\ncommunicate with people.\\n \\nBut, that last part - a way to communicate with people - is the most\\nimportant part. It\\'s how you get leads. So even though I had no\\nidea I was doing warm reach outs, one of the cor e four , it’ s how I\\ngot my first leads. I still  get leads this way (just with bigger\\nnumbers). And I’ll show you how you can too.\\n \\n \\nHow W arm Reach Outs W ork\\n \\n \\nW arm reach outs are when you make one-to-one contact with your\\nwarm audience - aka - the people who know you. It’ s the cheapest\\nand easiest way to find people interested in the stuf f you sell. It’ s\\nsuper ef fective–and most businesses don’ t do it. Don’ t be like most\\nbusinesses. Also, you do  have a warm audience, even if you don’ t\\nknow it. Everybody knows somebody . So your personal contacts\\nare the easiest place to start.\\n \\nW arm reach outs usually come in the form of calls, texts, emails,\\ndirect messages, voicemails, etc. And like we learned in Section II,\\nyou advertise one of two things. Y ou let them know about your\\nlead magnet (something free and valuable), or you let them know\\nabout your core of fer (the main thing you sell).\\n \\nWhen you start doing warm reach outs, you don’ t get many\\nengaged leads for your time. Y ou do everything on your own and\\nmake each message personal. But, for that reason, it is r eliable . As\\ncertain as the sun rises and sets,  it works .\\n \\nNote:  Reaching out to your warm audience works whether you\\nhave 100 contacts or 1,000,000. So as your business grows, you\\nwill use automation and employees to make it more ef ficient. The\\nsystems start small, with you, but they scale all the way up.  I detail\\nhow to scale these systems to lar ger audiences in Section IV .\\n \\nHow T o Do W arm Reach Outs in 10 Steps\\n \\nW arm reach outs are a fantastic way to get your “First Five\\nClients” For any new pr oduct or service. Advanced Folks: Think\\nre-engagement and new product lines. Here’ s how to do it:\\n \\nStep 1: Get your list\\n \\nStep 2: Pick a platform\\n \\nStep 3: Personalize your message\\n \\nStep 4: Reach out\\n \\nStep 5: W arm them up\\n \\nStep 6: Invite their friends\\n \\nStep 7:  Make them the easiest of fer in the world\\n \\nStep 8: Start at the top\\n \\nStep 9:  Start Char ging\\n \\nStep 10:  Keep Y our List W arm\\n \\n \\n(Step 1) “But I don’t have any leads…” → Everyone Has A\\nList\\n \\n \\nY ou know other humans. Let me prove it to you.\\n \\nGrab your phone. Inside you have contacts. Each contact has\\nsubscribed to communication fr om you . They have given you the\\nmeans and permission  to contact them.\\n \\nPull up all  the email accounts you’ve used over the years. Pull\\nyour contacts and address list from each. Bingo! Look at all\\nthem leads.\\n \\nNow , go to all your social media profiles. See your followers,\\nsubscribers, friends, connections, or whatever kids call ‘em\\nthese days...eureka – you got more leads!\\n \\nAdd up all  your contacts from all  the platforms. Seriously , figur e\\nout the number .  Between your phone, email, social media, and\\nother platforms you will have more than enough contacts to get\\nstarted. For many of you, this will be your first 1000 leads. W ould\\nya look at that! “I don’ t have any leads.” Psh. Just found some.\\n \\nAnd if you’r e terrified you’ll have to talk to people. Relax. Y ou’ll\\nlike what I’m gonna show you next.\\n \\n \\n(Step 2) “But I don’t know wher e to start…” → Pick A\\nPlatform\\n \\nPick the platform you have the most contacts on. Phone, email,\\nsocial media, mail, carrier pigeon, etc. It doesn’ t matter . Just pick\\nthe one with the most contacts. Y ou’ll hit ‘em all eventually\\nanyways.\\n \\n \\n(Step 3) “But what do I say?” → Personalize your gr eeting\\n \\nUse something you know about the contact as your actual reason to\\nreach out. If you don’ t have much personal info, you can check\\ntheir social media profiles etc. to learn a bit about them first.\\n \\nDon’ t be a weirdo. Pay your social dues. Remember , you haven’ t\\nasked for anything. Y ou’re just checking in and providing value.\\nSo…r elax .\\n \\nEx: Saw you just had a baby! Congrats! How is the baby doing?\\nHow ar e you?\\n \\n \\n(Step 4) “Now what?” → Reach. Out. T o. One. Hundr ed.\\nPeople. Every . Day .\\n \\n“T o get what you want, you have to deserve what you want.” -\\nCharlie Munger\\n \\nNow , reach out to 100 of them per day with your personalized\\nmessages. Y ou’ll call, text, email, message, send a postcard, etc.\\nAnd you will reach out to them up to three times. Once per day for\\nthree days* or until they respond. Whichever comes first.\\n \\n*Once per week with physical mail.\\n \\n \\n \\n(Step 5): “What do I say when they r espond?” → Act like a\\nhuman.\\n \\nNow we can br eak the ice without sounding icky .\\n \\nReply using the A - C - A  framework:\\n \\nA cknowledge  what they said. Restate it in your own words. This\\nshows active listening. \\n \\nEx: T wo kids. And you’r e an accountant… \\n \\nC ompliment  them on whatever they tell you. T ie it to a positive\\ncharacter trait if you can. \\n \\nEx: …W ow! Supermom! So har dworking! Managing a\\nfull-time car eer and two kids...\\n \\nA sk  another question. Lead the conversation in whatever\\ndirection you want. In this case, to a topic closer to your of fer .\\nExamples:\\n \\nTherapy/Life Coaching: … Do you get time for yourself?\\n \\nFitness/W eight Loss: ... Do you have time to get workouts\\nin?\\n \\nCleaning Services: ... Do you have anyone who helps you\\nkeep the house tidy?  \\n \\nThe ACA  framework is great because it helps you talk to anyone.\\nIt just so happens it’ s also  useful for letting people know about\\nyour stuf f. This means you can learn about the person and  guide\\nthe conversation toward your of fer .\\n \\nPeople love talking about themselves. So let them. They also love\\nto be complimented, so do that too. And if people feel good when\\ntalking to you, they’ll like and trust you more. Y ou want people to\\nlike and trust you mor e.  Besides, it’ s solid practice to find the good\\nin everyone anyway . Speaking of practice, this will take practice.\\nAnd that’ s OK.\\n \\n \\n \\n(Step 6) “How do I know if they’r e inter ested?” → Make them\\nan offer .\\n \\nGet through a ‘normal’ amount of conversation. Think 3-4\\nexchanges if on the phone or messaging and 3-4 minutes if in\\nperson. Then, you’ll make them an of fer to see if they’re\\ninterested.\\n \\nWhen I make an of fer from scratch, I refer to the value equation. If\\nyou’re wondering ‘what’ s the value equation?’ - it was the core\\nconcept of my first book $100M Offers.  V alue, as I define it, has\\nfour elements:\\n \\n \\n1) Dream Outcome : what the person wants to happen, the way they\\nwant it to happen\\n \\nState the best possible results your product can get. Big bonus\\npoints if those results come from people like the one you’re\\ntalking to.\\n \\n2) Perceived Likelihood of Achievement : how likely they think it\\nis for them to achieve their goal\\n \\nInclude results, reviews, awards, endorsements, certifications,\\nand other forms of 3r d party validation. Also, guarantees are\\nhuge.\\n \\n3) T ime Delay : how long they believe it’ll take to get results after\\nthey buy \\n \\nDescribe how fast people start  getting results, how often they\\nget results when they start, and how long it takes to get the best\\nresults possible.\\n \\n4) Ef fort and Sacrifice : The bad stuf f they\\'ll have to endure and the\\ngood stuf f they\\'ll have to give up in their struggle to get the result.\\n \\nShow them the good stuf f they can keep doing, or get to do, and\\nstill get results. And show them the bad stuf f that they can get\\nrid of, or avoid doing, and still get results. \\n \\nThe goal is to maximize the first two and minimize the second two.\\nSo all you have to do now is show someone:\\n \\nY ou have exactly what they want\\n \\nThey’re guaranteed to get it\\n \\nInsanely fast \\n \\nW ithout lifting a finger or giving up anything they love \\n \\nNo biggie, right? Obviously , that’ s ideal. W e gotta get as close to\\nthat as we can without lying or exaggerating. \\n \\nSo let’ s do just that with a real-life of fer:\\n \\n...By the way , do you know anybody  who is  (describe their\\nstruggles) looking to  (dream outcome) in  (time delay) ?  I’m taking\\non five case studies for fr ee, because that’ s all I can handle. I just\\nwant to get some testimonials for my service/pr oduct. I help them\\n(dream outcome) without  (ef fort and sacrifice). It works. I even\\nguarantee people get  (dream outcome) or I work with them until\\nthey do. I just had a girl named XXX work with me  (dream\\noutcome) even though she  (describe the same struggle your contact\\nhas). I also had another guy who  (dream outcome) and it was his\\nfirst time. I’d just like mor e testimonials to show it works acr oss\\ndiffer ent scenarios. Does anyone you like come to mind?  (Pause if\\non the phone) …and if they say no… Haha, well…does anyone you\\nhate  come to mind?  (ha) This helps break any awkwardness.\\n \\n \\nThere’ s an important feature here. W e’r e not asking them to buy\\nanything. W e’r e asking if they know anyone .  And of the people\\nwho say yes, most say they  are interested. This entire thing is\\nengineered to boost their  perceived likelihood of achievement. It’ s\\nwhy we show struggles and  results from people like them who\\nhave struggles like theirs. But, we let them  connect the dots. Since\\nyou didn’ t ask them to buy anything, you don’ t come of f as pushy .\\nSome people will show interest in your stuf f. Some will refer you\\nto those who might. Some will do both. In all three outcomes, you\\nwin. And you win without pushing anything on anyone.\\n \\nIf you have even less time or space to deliver it, just use the value\\nelements back to back:\\n \\nI help  (ideal customer) get  (dream outcome) in  (time period)\\nwithout  (ef fort and sacrifice) and  (increase perceived likelihood of\\nachievement–look at the pro tip below).\\n \\nNote: These work well for emails, texts, direct messages, calls, and\\nin-person. Just fill in the blanks.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(Step 7) “How do I get them to say yes?” → Make it easy for\\nthem to say yes. Make it fr ee.\\n \\n \\nAfter people show interest, make your of fer easy to say yes to. I\\nlike to start with the easiest of fer enhancer in the world - FREE:\\n \\nAnd don’ t try to look advanced if you’re not. People aren’ t dumb.\\nJust be honest and keep it simple:\\n \\nSince I’m only taking on five people, I can give you all the\\nattention you need to get brag-worthy r esults. And I’ll give it all\\nfor fr ee so long as you pr omise to: 1) Use it 2) Give me feedback\\nand 3) Leave a killer r eview if you think it deserves one. Does that\\nsound fair? \\n \\nThis sets reasonable expectations upfront.  And boom. Now , you’re\\njust helping people for free. W inning.\\n \\n \\nMy recommendation - whenever you launch a new product or\\nservice - make the first five free . The exact number matters less\\nthan knowing why you benefit from it. Here’ s why:\\n \\n1 . Y ou get the reps in and become comfortable with making of fers\\nto people. It’ll calm your nerves knowing you’re just helping…\\nfor free…for now (winky face). \\n \\n2 . Y ou probably suck (for now). People are far more for giving\\nwhen you haven’ t char ged anything.\\n \\n3 . Because you probably suck, you need to learn how to suck less.\\nY ou suck less by doing more.  It’ s better to have a few guinea\\npigs to get the kinks out. Y ou’ll learn a ton from the people you\\nhelp for free, I promise. Even though it may not feel like it now ,\\nyou’re getting the better end of the deal. \\n \\n4 . If people get value, especially for free, they’re far more likely\\nto:\\n \\na . Leave positive reviews and testimonials.\\n \\nb . Give you feedback.\\n \\nc . Send their friends and family .\\n \\nAnd if that’ s not awesome enough, free customers can make you\\nmoney in three other ways:\\n \\n1)  They convert into paying customers.\\n \\n2)  They send you paying customers via referrals.\\n \\n3)  Their testimonials bring in paying customers. \\n \\n \\nSo no matter what, you win.\\n \\n \\nWhat if they say no?\\n \\nOften, the most expensive part of what you sell isn’ t the price–it\\'s\\nthe hidden costs. Hidden costs  are the time, ef fort, and sacrifice it\\ntakes to get results from the thing you sell. In other words, the\\nbottom part of the value equation . If you struggle to give your stuf f\\naway for free, it means either people don’ t want it (dream\\noutcome), they don’ t believe you (perceived likelihood of\\nachievement) or  the hidden costs (time, ef fort and sacrifice) are too\\nhigh. In short, your ‘free’ stuf f is too expensive . So figure out the\\nhidden costs. Once you do, you unlock even more value–that\\nyou’ll eventually be able to char ge for .\\n \\nT o build your understanding of hidden costs… ask.  So when\\nsomeone says “no” ask “why?”:\\n \\n“What would I have to do to make it worth it for you to continue?”\\n \\nTheir answers give you a chance to solve their problem. And if you\\nsolve that problem, they’ll probably buy from you. And even if\\nthey don’ t buy from you, they’ll give you the ammo to get the next\\nperson to.\\n \\nAnd remember , failure is a requisite for success. It’ s part of the\\nprocess. So rack up failures as fast as you can. Get them out of the\\nway to start paying down your “no tax.” If you get thousands of\\nnos, you will get your yeses, I promise. I always tell myself: Y eses\\ngive me opportunity . Nos give me feedback. Either way , I win.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(Step 8) “What Do I Do Once I’ve Reached Out T o Everyone?”\\n→ Start Back At The T op\\n \\n \\nAfter reaching out to all the leads on one platform, switch to the\\nplatform you have the second most leads on. After you reach out to\\nthose leads, go to the platform you have the third most leads on\\nand so forth.\\n \\nLet’ s say you follow this to the tee because being poor sucks more\\nthan helping people for free. If between all platforms, you have\\n1000 leads, that gives you ten solid days of work. A month of work\\nincluding follow-ups. By this point, I promise, five or mor e people\\nwill have accepted your fr ee offer .  And some will have converted\\ninto paying customers. If you did a good job, they’ll send friends,\\nand they’ll become paying customers too.\\n \\nSo, let’ s make our first dollar .\\n \\n \\n(Step 9) “But I can’t work for fr ee for ever…” → Start\\nCharging.\\n \\n \\nThis is important. This is your litmus test to know when you’re\\n“good enough” to char ge. Once people start r eferring, start\\nchar ging .  When that happens, swap out ‘… fr ee…’  in the script\\nabove to ‘80% off  for the next five’. Then ‘ 60% off  for the next\\nfive.’ Then ‘ 40% off  for the next five,’ and so forth. The “I\\nincrease my prices every five” rule also adds ur gency because\\nprices actually  go up. And if you’re curious, you don’ t have to stop\\nraising your price. Feel free to keep raising it by 20% every five\\nuntil you find your sweet spot. It’ s your business. Y ou can do what\\nyou want. Char ge more as you get more experienced - a nice\\nreward.\\n \\n \\n \\n(Step 10) “But what do I do fr om her e?” →Keep your list\\nwarm.\\n \\nGive regular value to your list through email, social media, etc. to\\nkeep it warm. A warm list stays primed for your warm reach outs\\nin the future. W e cover exactly how to give that value in the next\\nchapter . Once you’ve given value for a while, or see who wants\\nvalue, probe your list with Dean Jackson\\'s timeless \"9-word email\"\\ntemplate”:\\n \\nAr e you still looking to [4 wor d desir e]?\\n \\nNo images. No frills. No links. Just a question. Nothing else. This\\nmessage is money for getting leads to engage. And it’ s among the\\nfirst things I do when I invest in a new business. Here are a few\\nexamples:\\n \\nAr e you still looking to\\n \\n…buy your dr eam home?\\n \\n…get mor e sales leads?\\n \\n…tone up your arms?\\n \\n…open an online stor e?\\n \\n…start a Y ouT ube channel?\\n \\nY ou get the idea. Swipe and deploy . Y ou make the ask to see who\\nreplies - aka - engaged leads. And these r eplies should be your top\\npriority for warm r each outs.\\n \\nI’ll end step 10 here because I break down this “give-ask” process\\nin the next chapter . The main point is that a warm list is a huge\\nasset because it’ s a consistent and gr owing  source of engaged\\nleads. If you treat them well, your audience will feed you forever .\\n \\n \\nAdvertising Checklist Summary\\n \\nNow let’ s look at this in ten lines because it took ten pages to get\\nhere.\\n \\n \\nBenchmarks: How well am I doing?\\n \\n \\nW arm reach outs should get about one in five contacts to engage.\\nSo one hundred warm reach outs should get about twenty replies.\\nOf the twenty who reply , another one in five ish  will take you up on\\nyour free of fer . So, four people. Of the four who take your free\\nof fer now , you should be able to convert one  into some sort of paid\\nof fer later . Hooray - money .\\n \\nThis framework allows you to predict how many customers you\\nget per 100 warm reach outs. In the example, you would get one\\ncustomer per 100 reach outs. These numbers vary based on the\\nvalue of your of fer and how much they trust you. But, no matter\\nwhat, with enough volume,  you will get a customer . And the more\\nyou do it, the better your numbers will get. It just takes ef fort.\\nY ou’ll also learn a lot about what engages your audience: what\\nthey value and how to make of fers to them. This knowledge can\\nmake you millions. Y ou get to learn while you earn - score.\\n \\nThis process alone  can take you to $100,000+ per year with\\nnothing else. W ild, I know . Here’ s the money math:\\n \\nThis assumes 1% of your list buys a $400 of fer using  only  warm\\nreach outs.\\n \\n500 reach outs per week = 5 customers per week\\n \\n$400 product → 5 customers per week x $400 each = $2000/wk\\n \\n$2000/wk x 52 weeks = $104,000…bingo.\\n \\nWhich, as of this writing, is still two times the median household\\nincome in the US. Not bad.\\n \\n \\n \\nY ou’ll learn more in the first ten days of doing  100 reach outs than\\nyou did from everything you’ve ever read or watched. Get that\\nlearning done as fast as you can. Remember , we want to get rich,\\nnot just “get by .”\\n \\n \\nWhat’ s Next?\\n \\nW arm reach outs have two limitations.\\n \\nThe first is time. When you\\'re starting out, getting new customers\\nshould take the majority of your time. Think four hours per day ,\\nminimum. It should be the first thing you do when you get up. And\\nyou shouldn’ t stop until you achieve your goal. Embrace the work.\\nIt will be part of the story you tell one day . It has been for me.\\n \\nThe second limiter is the number of people who know you. Y ou’ll\\neventually “run out.” Don’ t worry though. W e can get more. A lot\\nmore. Now we add  the second of the core four advertising\\nactivities: posting free content.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n# 2  P o s t  F r e e  C o n t e n t  P a r t  I\\nHow T o Build An Audience T o Get Engaged Leads\\nNo one’ s ever complained about getting too much value.\\n \\n \\nJanuary 2020\\n \\n“Did you hear about Kylie Jenner?” Leila asked.\\n \\n“No, why?” I replied.\\n \\n“She’ s now the youngest female self-made billionaire.”\\n \\n“W ait, what?”\\n \\n“Y ea, she’ s twenty . Forbes just put her on the cover .”\\n \\nI was ten years older than her and not  a billionaire. Why do I suck so\\nmuch?  How could she make so much more than me? I thought I was\\npretty good at business–we took home $13M in personal income the\\nyear before. But, I was clearly missing something. And I felt horrible\\nabout it.\\n \\nMy ego protected me… W ell, Kris Jenner is her mother and she\\nmust have or ganized all this.  I wrote it of f as “rich parents” and\\nmoved on.\\n \\n \\nA few months later…\\n \\nLeila looked up from her computer .\\n \\n“Dude - Huda just sold a minority stake in her company at a $600M\\nvaluation.”\\n \\n“Huda, the makeup girl?” I replied.\\n \\n“Y ea.”\\n \\n“Holy cow .” Again?  How have I been scr ewing up so bad?  How was\\nsomeone so young making so much more money than me?\\n \\n…She’ s in beauty , she can do that, I can’ t.  I told myself, then carried\\non.\\n \\n \\nA few months later…\\n \\nA headline caught my eye:\\n \\n“Conor McGregor ’ s Proper 12 whiskey hits a $600M valuation\\nwithin 12 months of launching.”\\nSeriously!? - Another  person making gobs of money in what felt like\\nseconds.\\n \\n \\nA few months later…\\n \\nI saw another headline. “W ith an Insane $3.5 Billion W orth, Dwayne\\nJohnson’ s ‘T er emana’ Sweeps the Floor W ith Conor McGr egor ’ s\\n‘Pr oper 12′.”\\n \\nDwayne “The Rock” Johnson was now a multi-billionaire. And he\\nnever even talked about business! What am I doing wr ong?\\n \\n \\nA few months later… at a famous friend’ s house…\\n \\nUp to this point, I stayed behind the scenes for the most part. I did\\nnot want to be famous. I wanted to be rich. And I succeeded at that.\\nBut seeing these successes chipped away at my beliefs. Could\\nbuilding a personal brand be that  powerful? Simple answer - yes.\\nBut, I wanted my privacy…\\n \\nW e sat around his kitchen table, and I asked him, “Y ou get all these\\nweird messages from strangers. People threaten your family . Are you\\nstill happy you became famous?” He replied with something that\\nchanged my life forever:\\n \\n“If getting weird messages and hate from  people I don\\'t know is the\\nprice I have to pay to make the impact I want to have, I’d pay that\\nprice any day of the week.”\\n \\nI felt exposed. I was being a pansy . I claimed I wanted to make the\\nimpact, but wasn’ t willing to pay the price for it. After that\\nconversation, Leila and I went all in on building personal brands.\\n \\n***\\n \\nI have a core belief I’d like to transfer to you. If someone is making\\nmore money than you, they are better at the game of business in\\nsome way .  T ake it as good news. It means you can learn from them.\\nDon’ t think they had it easy . Don’ t think they had a shortcut. Don’ t\\ntell yourself they broke some moral code. Even if it’ s true, none of\\nthose beliefs serve you. None of those beliefs  make you better .\\n \\nY ears ago, I was vocal about “making content.” I didn’ t see the\\npoint. Why would I waste my time making something that would\\ndisappear in a few days? I thought it was a stupid waste of time and\\nlet everyone know . I was wrong. It really wasn’ t about the content at\\nall - it was about the audience. What I didn’ t understand was - the\\ncontent you create isn’ t the compounding asset - the audience is . So\\neven though the content may disappear in time, your audience keeps\\ngrowing.\\n \\nThis was a lesson my ego prevented me from learning for too long. It\\ntook an entire year of getting hit in the face with solid evidence\\nbefore I changed my ways. Building an audience is the most\\nvaluable thing I’ve ever done.\\n \\nI saw Kylie Jenner , Huda Kattan, Connor McGregor , and The Rock\\nbecome billionaires “overnight.” My famous friend said a massive\\naudience was crucial to his success. The overwhelming evidence\\nbroke my beliefs, so I rewrote them. I now saw the power of having\\nan audience. But, I didn’ t know where to start. So, I did what I\\nalways do. I paid for knowledge.  Buying somebody else’ s experience\\nsaves the time it would take to figure everything out yourself. Leila\\nbought me four calls with a big influencer who had the type of\\naudience I wanted to build. She paid $120,000.\\n \\nOn my first call, he told me to post regularly on every platform. So,\\nthat\\'s what I did. T welve months later , my audience grew by more\\nthan 200,000 people. On my second call, he noted the progress. But I\\nwanted more, “Do you have a blueprint for your personal branding?\\nHow do you put out all that content?”\\n \\nHe said, “Bro, anyone telling you there’ s some secret is trying to sell\\nyou something. W e just put out as much as we possibly can. Pull up\\nyour Instagram and pull up my Instagram... Look. Y ou’ve posted\\nonce today . I posted three times. Pull up your LinkedIn… Look. Y ou\\nposted once this week. I posted five times today .” He went platform\\nby platform. I grew more embarrassed with each comparison.\\n \\n“Y ou just gotta do more bro.”\\n \\nSimple. Not easy . Over the next six months I put out ten times  the\\ncontent. And over the next six months, I added 1.2M people to my\\naudience. Also, when I put out ten times the content, my audience\\ngrew ten times as fast. V olume works. Content works. A growing\\naudience is the result. And in this chapter , I’ll break down how I did\\nit so you can too.\\n \\n \\nHow Building An Audience W orks - Y ou Post Gr eat Fr ee\\nContent\\n \\n \\nW arm reach outs don’ t get a lot of engaged leads for the time we\\ninvest. If we want to reach ten people, we have to repeat ourselves\\nten times. Lots of ef fort. By posting free content, we can say it once\\nand reach all ten. So, posting free content can get a lot more engaged\\nleads for the time we invest. Hooray .\\n \\nThe people who think it’ s valuable become part of your warm\\naudience. If they think other people will find it valuable, they share\\nit. And if the people they share it with like it, they become part of\\nyour warm audience too. Rinse and repeat. The sharing can go on\\ninfinitely .  The more they share your stuf f, the lar ger your warm\\naudience gets. And once in a while, you’ll make them an of fer . If\\nyour of fer has enough value, they’ll take it. When they do, you make\\nmoney . And the bigger the audience, the more money you make .\\nLook at it this way:\\n \\nPosting free content grows your warm audience.\\n \\nSo constantly posting free content means you’ll have a constantly\\ngrowing audience of people more likely to buy your stuf f.\\n \\nFree content makes all other advertising more ef fective. If you\\nreach out to someone and they can’ t find content related to your\\nservices, they’re less likely to buy . On the other hand, if they find\\nlots of valuable content, they are more likely to buy .\\n \\nThis is what my ego pr evented me fr om learning.  Now the headlines\\nwith Jenner , Huda, McGregor , and The Rock all made perfect sense.\\n \\nBut, posting free content is not all sunshine and rainbows. It has\\ntrade-of fs. First, it is more dif ficult to personalize your message. So\\nfewer people respond. Second, you compete with everyone else\\nposting free content. This makes it harder  to stand out. Third, if you\\ndo stand out, people will copy you. This means you need to\\nconstantly innovate.\\n \\nThat being said - A bigger audience means more engaged leads.\\nMore engaged leads means more money . More money means you\\nmore happy . Just kidding - it won’ t do that. But it’ll give you the\\nresources to remove stuf f you hate. Anyways…\\n \\nThis chapter covers only two topics. First, we demystify audience-\\ngrowing content by showing it’ s all made of the same basic units. A\\ncontent unit has three components - Hook, retain, and reward.\\nSecond, how linking basic units together will make audience-\\ngrowing content for any platform or media type. The next chapter\\n(Post Free Content Part II) shows you how to weaponize this content\\nto make money . But for now , you can’ t monetize content until you\\nknow how to make it.\\n \\n \\nThe Content Unit - Thr ee Components\\n \\n \\nAll audience-growing content does one thing - it rewards the people\\nconsuming it. And a person can only get rewarded by the content if\\nthey:\\n \\n1)  Have a reason to consume it and\\n \\n2)  Pay attention long enough to\\n \\n3)  Get that reason satisfied.\\n \\nThankfully , we can reverse those three outcomes into the three\\nthings we have to do to make audience-growing content .  This means\\nwe have to:\\n \\na)   Hook  attention: get them to notice your content.\\n \\nb)  Retain  attention: get them to consume it.\\n \\nc)   Reward  attention: satisfy the reason they consumed it to begin\\nwith.\\n \\nThe smallest amount of material it takes to hook, retain and reward\\nattention is a content unit . It can be as little as an image, a meme, or\\na sentence. Meaning, you can hook, retain, and reward at the same\\ntime . This is how short tweets, meme images, or even a jingle can go\\nviral. They do all three. I separate them so we can discuss them more\\nclearly , but they can all happen at once.\\n \\nLet’ s dive into each of the things we do to create a content unit. This\\nway you can create ef fective content that grows your audience.\\n \\n \\n1) Hook: They cannot be rewarded unless we first get their attention.\\n \\n \\nThe objective : W e give them a reason to redirect their attention from\\nwhatever they are doing towards us. If we do that, we’ve hooked\\nthem. The ef fectiveness of your hook is measured by the percentage\\nof people who start consuming your content. So if you hook\\nattention well, many  people will have a reason to consume your\\ncontent. If you do a poor job, few  people will have a reason to\\nconsume your content. Remember , this is a competition for attention.\\nW e have to beat every alternative they have to win theirs. Make\\nyourself the best option.\\n \\nW e increase the percentage of people who pick our content by\\npicking topics  they find interesting, headlines  that give them a\\nreason, and matching the format  of other stuf f they like. Let’ s dive\\ninto each.\\n \\nT opics. T opics are the things you make your content about. I prefer\\nto use personal experiences. Here’ s why: there’ s only one of you.\\nThe easiest way to dif ferentiate is to say something no one else can\\nsay . And no one else has lived your life but you. I divide topics into\\nfive categories: Far Past, Recent Past, Present, T rending, and\\nManufactured.\\n \\na)   Far Past : The important past  lessons in your life. Connect that\\nwisdom to your product or service to provide huge value to your\\naudience. Give them the story without the scar . It’ s why I write\\nthese books .\\n \\ni)             Example: A personal lesson where I broke my belief\\nthat “I don\\'t have enough time”:\\n \\n1)  Hook: I complained to a friend that I didn’ t have\\nenough time to do something while glued to my\\nphone.\\n \\n2)  Retain: They yanked it out of my hands and looked\\nat its usage. It showed I spent three hours per day\\non social media.\\n \\n3)  Reward: They looked back at me and said, “Hey , I\\nfound you some time.”\\n \\nIt’ s a simple story other people can relate to. This\\nmakes it an interesting topic to more people. And it\\nconnects what I do, growing businesses, to a struggle\\nmany people experience - not having enough time.\\nThe epiphany I give away makes this lesson valuable\\nfor my audience – people starting, growing, and selling\\ntheir businesses.\\n \\nb)  Recent Past : Do stuf f, then talk about what you did (or what\\nhappened). Any time you speak with somebody , there’ s a chance\\nyour audience can get value from it. Look at your calendar for the\\nlast week. Look at all your meetings. Look at all your social\\ninteractions. Look at all your conversations with warm reach outs.\\nTher e’ s gold in these conversations . T ell stories from them that\\nwould serve your audience. For example:\\n \\n \\ni)             This tweet came from a meeting I had with a portfolio\\nCEO that was just copying the same of fer everyone else\\nin his market was making and was getting subpar results.\\n \\nii)             This means taking notes, recordings, and other records\\nto make that stuf f easy to access. But it also means a free,\\neasy , and valuable stash of content.\\n \\niii)             T estimonials and case studies fall in this category . If you\\ncan tell a cool client story in a way that pr ovides value to\\nyour audience , you’ll both promote your services and\\nprovide value. W in-win.\\n \\nc) Present : W rite down ideas at the exact time they come to you .\\nAlways have a way to record your ideas in arms reach. I’ll even\\npause meetings to make note of, text, or email ideas to myself.\\nPeople don’ t mind when you ask to take notes anyway , so it\\'s not\\nweird. Then, when you make content, you have a bucket of fresh\\nstories to work with.\\n \\ni)             I note my ideas publicly: I used to keep ideas to myself.\\nNow , I tweet them publicly as they happen. If a post does\\nbetter than normal, I know it\\'s something people find\\ninteresting. Then, I make more stuf f on that topic.\\n \\nd) T rending : Go where the attention is. Look at what’ s trending right\\nnow and make stuf f about it. Apply your own experiences to it. If\\nyou have relevant commentary or it touches your expertise in\\nsome way , talk about it. T alking about trendy stuf f is very\\nef fective for gaining the attention of a broader audience.\\n \\ne) Manufactured : T urn your ideas into reality .  Pick a topic people\\nfind interesting. Then, learn about it, make it, or do it. Then, show\\nit to the world. This costs the most time and ef fort since you have\\nto create the experience versus talking about one you already had.\\nBut, it can have the biggest payouts.\\n \\ni)             Example manufactured experience: I lived on $100 for a\\nmonth. Her e’ s how .  Now I don’ t live that way , but I could\\nmanufacture that experience then make content about it.\\n \\n \\nAction Step : Life happens–profit by sharing yours.\\n \\n \\nHeadlines . A headline is a short phrase or sentence used to grab the\\naudience’ s attention. It communicates the reason they should\\nconsume the content. They use it to weigh the likelihood they will\\nget a reward for consuming your content versus another .\\n \\nRather than give you a bunch of templates, I’d rather give you the\\ntimeless principles that make great headlines. And, there’ s no greater\\nheadline creator than “the news.” So let’ s study them.\\n \\nA meta-analysis of news revealed headline components that drove\\nthe most interest in stories. They are as follows. T ry and include at\\nleast two in your headline.\\n \\na . Recency  - As recent as possible, quite literally the ‘new’ s\\n \\ni . Example: People pay attention to something that\\nhappened an hour ago more than a year ago.\\n \\nb . Relevancy  - Personally meaningful\\n \\ni . Example: Nurses pay more attention to stuf f that af fects\\nnurses compared to stuf f that af fects accountants.\\n \\nc . Celebrity  - Including prominent people (celebrities, authorities,\\netc.).\\n \\ni . Example: Normally , we wouldn’ t care what another\\nhuman has for breakfast every day . But if it’ s Jef f\\nBezos, we do. Since he’ s a celebrity , many people care.\\n \\nd . Proximity  - Close to home – geographically\\n \\ni . Example: A house on fire across the country doesn’ t get\\nyour attention. If it’ s your neighbor , it sure does. Make\\nit as close to home as possible.\\n \\ne . Conflict  - of opposing ideas, opposing people, nature, etc.\\n \\ni . Example: Pineapple vs no Pineapple on pizza?\\nConflict!\\n \\nii . Example: Good vs Evil. Hero vs V illain. Left vs Right.\\n \\niii . Example: Freedom vs Security . Justice vs Mercy . Y ou\\nget the idea.\\n \\nf . Unusual  - odd, unique, rare, bizarre\\n \\ni . Example: Think of a six-fingered man at the old-time\\ncircuses. If it’ s outside of the norm, people pay more\\nattention.\\n \\ng . Ongoing  - Stories still in progress are dynamic, evolving, and\\nhave plot twists.\\n \\ni . Example: If someone goes into labor , people want\\nupdates every ten minutes because anything could\\nhappen .\\n \\nAction Step : Include one or more of these components to give\\nyourself meatier , attention-grabbing headlines.\\n \\n \\nFormat . Once we have a good topic and communicate it with a\\nheadline using one or more components, we need to match our\\nformat to the best content on the platform. People consume content\\nbecause it’ s similar to stuf f they’ve liked in the past. And matching\\nthe popular format of the platform gets the most people to interact\\nwith it. So, we want to make our content look like the stuf f they’ve\\nliked before.\\n \\nFormat example:\\n \\n \\nThis meme communicates the point better than I can with words. All\\nfour images above are…well…images. But, they have a dif ferent\\nlook and feel. This is because formatting depends on the audience\\nyou want to hook and  the platform your audience is on.\\n \\nBottom Line:  Y ou’ve gotta make your content look like what they\\nexpect will r ewar d them. Otherwise, no matter how good it is, better -\\nlooking content will hook them before yours even has a chance.\\n \\nAction Step : Format your content for the platform first. Then, tweak\\nit so it hooks your ideal audience. Use the best content on the\\nplatform that tar gets your market as your guide.\\n \\nThis concludes the “hook” step of our content unit. Always  following\\nthese basics will already put you in the top 1%. At least, it has for\\nme.\\n \\n \\n2) Retain\\n \\nMy favorite driver of retention is curiosity . It’ s my favorite because,\\nif done correctly , people will wait years. People want to know what\\nhappens… next . For example, I get messages daily , for years now ,\\nabout when I will release a book on sales.\\n \\nMy favorite way to get the audience curious is to embed questions in\\ntheir minds. Unresolved questions can be explicit or implicit. Y ou\\ncan directly ask the question. Or , the question can be implied. My\\nthree favorite ways to embed questions are: lists, steps, and stories.\\n \\n \\na)   Lists : Lists are things, facts, tips, opinions, ideas, etc. presented\\none after the other . Good lists in free content also follow a theme.\\nThink “T op 10 Mistakes” or “5 Biggest Money Makers” and so\\non. Giving the number of listed items in your headline, or in the\\nfirst few seconds of your content, tells people what to expect. And\\nin my experience, this retains more of the audience\\'s attention for\\nlonger .\\n \\ni)             Example: “7 W ays I invested $1000 in my 20s That\\nPaid Of f Big”\\n \\nii)             Example: “28 W ays T o Stay Poor”  \\n \\niii)             Example: “A content unit has three pieces…”,\\n \\nb)  Steps : Steps are actions that occur in order and accomplish a goal\\nwhen completed. Provided the early steps were clear and valuable,\\nthe person will want to know how to do them all to accomplish the\\noverall goal.\\n \\ni)             Example: “3 Steps to Creating a Great Hook”\\n \\nii)             Example: “How I Create a Headline in 7 Steps”\\n \\niii)             Example: “The Morning Routine That Boosts My\\nProductivity”\\n \\nNote: Here’ s the dif ference between steps and lists. Steps are actions\\nthat must be done in a specific or der  to get a result. So steps are less\\nflexible but have a more explicit reward. Lists can have just about\\nanything on them in any order you want. So lists are more flexible\\nbut have a less explicit reward.\\n \\nc)   Stories : Stories describe events, real or imaginary . And stories\\nworth telling often have some lesson or takeaway for the listener .\\nY ou can tell stories about things that have happened , might\\nhappen , or will never happen.  All three drive curiosity because\\npeople want to know what happens next.\\n \\ni)             Ex: Almost every chapter in this book has a story .\\n \\nii)             Ex: “My editor made me do 19 drafts of this book -\\nhere’ s what I did to him.”\\n \\niii)             Ex: “My journey from sleeping on the bottom floor of a\\ngym to the top floor of a 5-star hotel.”\\n \\nY ou can use lists, steps, and stories on their own or interweave them.\\nFor example, you can have lists within steps, and a story about each\\nlist item. Y ou can have stories to reinforce the value of a step. Y ou\\ncan have a list of stories or many ongoing storylines. Etc. Y our\\ncreativity is the only limit here. That’ s why people who make a lot of\\ncontent call themselves content cr eators . This chapter , for example,\\nhas lists within steps and stories interweaving them.\\n \\nAction Step : Use lists, steps, and stories to keep your audience\\ncurious. Embed questions in their minds to make them want to know\\nwhat happens next .\\n \\n \\n3) Reward\\n \\nAnyone can think of cool hooks and or ganize their content using\\nlists, steps, or stories. But the real question is - is it good? Does it\\nsatisfy the reason they watched to begin with? Does it make people\\nwant to share it? How good your content is depends on how often it\\nrewards your audience in the time it takes them to consume it . Think\\nvalue per second . For example, the same person who gets bored\\nthree seconds into a ten-second video may also binge a 900-page\\nbook. And that same person may binge a television series for eight\\nhours straight. So there is no such thing as too long, only too boring .\\n \\nNow , we can’ t guarantee a specific reward. But, we can increase the\\nchance reward happens by:\\n \\nHooking the right  audience with proper topics, headlines, and\\nformatting\\n \\nRetaining them with lists, steps, and stories to get them curious\\nand wanting more  \\n \\nClearly satisfying the reason the content hooked them to begin\\nwith.\\n \\nExample: If your hook promises “7 W ays to Make Up with Y our\\nSpouse” and you give:\\n \\n(A) four ways (B) seven ways that stunk (or they’ve heard them all\\nbefore). (C) you’re talking to a room of single guys who don’ t have\\nspouses, you did a bad job of r ewar ding. People will not want to\\nwatch again, and certainly won’ t share it.\\n \\nExample: If your hook promises “4 Marketing Strategies Dentists\\nCan Use” and they can’ t use them, they will not share it or watch\\nyour content in the future. Y ou did a bad job of r ewar ding.\\n \\nBottom line:  I’ve had tons of content I thought would smash records\\nbut the audience smashed the next button instead. So no matter how\\ngood you think your content is, the audience decides.  Rewarding\\nyour audience means matching or exceeding their expectations when\\nthey decide to consume your content .  Here’ s how you know if you\\nsucceeded: your audience gr ows . If it’ s not growing, your stuf f isn’ t\\nthat good. Practice and you’ll get better .\\n \\nAction Step : Provide more value than anyone else. Make good on\\nyour promises. Clearly satisfy the hook you used to get their\\nattention. In other words, completely answer the unresolved\\nquestions you embedded in their minds.\\n \\n \\nSo what’ s the differ ence between short and long form content?\\nAnswer: not much.\\n \\nIf you recall from earlier , the smallest amount of material it takes to\\nhook, retain and reward attention is a content unit . So to create a\\nlonger piece of content, we simply link content units together .\\n \\nFor example, a single step in a five-step list might be a content unit.\\nWhen we link all five together , we have a longer piece of content.\\nHere’ s a visual to drive it home.\\n \\n \\nShorter content hooks, retains, rewards fewer times. Longer content\\ndoes it more times. And doing it more times takes more skill because\\nyou have to string more “good” content units in a row . For example,\\na new comedian typically will only get a few minutes on stage to\\nperform their “bit.” Only a master comic gets an hour . It takes\\npractice to reward attention just often enough to keep it for that long.\\nSo, start small, then build from there. Even if you start with longer\\ncontent, which is fine, I suggest starting with shorter versions. Y ou’ll\\nhave an easier go of it. Many successful authors with epic-length\\nnovels started by writing…you guessed it…short stories.\\n \\n \\nOnce you understand how to make a content unit, all you have to do\\nis mor e . Then, your audience will grow . And once your audience\\ngrows big enough, you may want to monetize it. I had too much to\\nsay to fit into one chapter , so we’ll talk about how to monetize the\\naudience in the next one.\\n \\n \\nSee you there.\\n# 2  P o s t  F r e e  C o n t e n t  P a r t  I I\\nMonetize Y our Audience\\n \\n“Give-give-give, give-give-give, until they ask”\\n \\n \\nThe point of this chapter is to show you how to monetize your\\nwarm audience. First, we talk about how we can make of fers and\\nnot be a spam monster - mastering the give : ask ratio. Then we’ll\\ntalk about the two of fer strategies to monetize the audience. After\\nthat, I’ll talk about how to scale your output so you can grow a\\nbigger audience faster and make even more money . Then, I’ll share\\na bunch of lessons I’ve learned in building my own audience that I\\nwish I had known sooner . Finally , I’ll wrap this up with how you\\ncan take action on everything today .\\n \\n \\nMastering the Give : Ask ratio\\n \\nGary V aynerchuk popularized “jab, jab, jab, right hook.” It\\nsimplifies the idea of giving to your audience many times before\\nmaking an ask. Y ou deposit goodwill with rewarding content, then\\nwithdraw from it by making of fers. When you deposit goodwill,\\nyour audience pays more attention. When you deposit goodwill,\\nyour audience is more likely to do what you ask. So I try to “under -\\nask” my audience and build as much goodwill as possible.\\n \\nThankfully , the give : ask ratio has been well-studied. T elevision\\naverages 13 minutes of advertising per 60 minutes of air time. That\\nmeans 47 min are dedicated to ‘giving,’ and 13 min are dedicated\\nto ‘asking’. That’ s roughly a 3.5:1 ratio of giving to asking. On\\nFacebook, it’ s roughly 4 content posts for every 1 ad on the\\nnewsfeed. This gives us an idea of the minimum give : ask ratio we\\ncan sustain. After all, television and Facebook are mature\\nplatforms. They care less about growing their audiences and care\\nmore about making money from them. So they give less and ask\\nmore. Which means “give, give, give, ask” is the ratio that gets us\\ncloser to maximally monetizing  an audience without shrinking it.\\nBut, most of us want to grow , so we shouldn’ t model them. W e\\nshould model growing platforms.\\n \\nSo what do growing platforms do? They display lots of content\\nwithout many advertisements at all. In short, they give give give…\\ngive give give…give give give…give give give…maybe ask. They\\ndramatically over give and under ask. Why? Because the more you\\nreward your audience, the bigger it gets. So if you want to grow an\\naudience, give far far more than you ask.\\n \\n\\n \\nAnd now that I have some experience with it, I’ve got a slight\\ntweak on the traditional give-ask strategy that puts it on steroids:\\nGive until they ask.\\n \\n \\nPeople are always waiting for you to ask for money . And when you\\ndon’ t, they trust you more. They share your stuf f more. Y ou grow\\nfaster , etc. But I’m not some altruistic saint. I’m here to make\\nmoney . After all, I wouldn’ t be a good businessman if I weren’ t\\nmaking any .\\n \\nSo, it’ s simple. If you give enough, people start asking you . It\\nmakes people uncomfortable to continue to receive without giving\\nback. It is core to our culture and DNA. They’ll go to your website,\\nDM you, email you, etc., to ask for more. Not only that, when you\\nuse this strategy , you get the best  customers. They are the ones\\nwho are the biggest ‘givers.’ They are the ones who, even as\\npaying customers, still feel they get the better end of the deal. And\\nbest of all, if you advertise this way , your gr owth never slows .\\nWhen you use this strategy , you give in public, ask in private . Y ou\\nlet the audience self-select when they’re ready to give you money .\\nThat’ s why , in my opinion, give until they ask  is the best strategy .\\nBut, if you feel like asking, I get it. So, let’ s talk about how to ask.\\nIf you’re gonna do it, you might as well do it well.\\n \\nBottom Line:  The moment you start asking for money is the\\nmoment you decide to slow down your growth. So the more patient\\nyou are, the more you will get when you finally make your ask.\\n \\nAction Step:  Give give give give give give until they ask\\n \\n \\n \\nHow T o Make Money Fr om Content: Ask\\n \\n \\nT o be clear , I think you should use the give until they ask  strategy .\\nBut, if you need to pay rent, feed your family , etc., I get it.\\nSometimes you gotta ask. So let’ s talk about how to do that\\nwithout sounding like a nincompoop.\\n \\nThink of ‘asks’ as commercials. Y ou interrupt this pr ogram with a\\nvery important message . Since you are the one providing the value,\\nyou interrupt your own content with commercials about the stuf f\\nyou sell. But, since it’ s your audience, you pay the cost of potential\\nloss of trust, slowing growth, and of course, the time it took you to\\ngather the audience in the first place. But money-wise, it’ s free.\\nNow , I use two strategies to weave promotions into content:\\nintegrated of fers and intermittent of fers. Let’ s cover both.\\n \\n \\nIntegrated : Y ou can advertise in every piece of content so long as\\nyou keep your give : ask ratio high. Y ou will continue to grow your\\nwarm audience and  get engaged leads. W in-win.\\n \\nFor example, if I make an hour -long podcast, having 3 x 30-second\\nads means I’d have 58.5 min of giving to 1.5 min of asking. W ell\\nabove the 3:1 ratio.\\n \\nOn the flip side, I had a friend who had a podcast that blew up\\nquickly . Eager to monetize his new audience, he started making\\nof fers (asking) too frequently - in-  the content. His podcast not only\\nstopped growing, it actually shrank! Don’ t be like that. Don’ t kill\\nyour golden goose. It’ s a balancing act. Over -give to protect your\\nmost valuable asset - the goodwill of your audience.\\n \\nAction step : I most commonly integrate the ‘asks’ - aka - CT As\\nafter a valuable moment or the end of the content piece. Consider\\ntrying one of those places first - and make sure your audience\\ngrowth doesn’ t slow . Then add in the second and so forth.\\n \\n \\n \\nIntermittent : The second way you can monetize is through\\nintermittent asks. Here’ s how it works. Y ou make many pieces of\\ncontent of pure ‘gives’ then occasionally make an ‘ask’ piece.\\nExample: Y ou make 10 ‘give’ posts, and on the 1 1th, you promote\\nyour stuf f.\\n \\nThe dif ference between the first way and the second way depends\\non the platform. On short platforms, the intermittent way will\\ndominate. On long-form platforms, integrations are often your best\\nbet.\\n \\nWhen you make your ask, you either advertise  your cor e offer ,  or\\nyou advertise your lead magnet . That’ s it. Don’ t overcomplicate\\nthis.\\n \\nLead Magnet Example:  If I just talked about a way to get more\\nleads on a post/video/podcast/etc., I would then say , “I have 1 1\\nmore tips that have helped me do this. Go to my site to grab a\\npretty visual of them.” And as long as I have an audience that\\nwants to get more leads, this will get some of them to engage.\\nThen, the thank you page after the opt-in page for my lead magnet\\nwould display my paid of fer with some video explaining how it\\nworks. Bonus points if your lead magnet is relevant to your content\\nadvertising it.\\n \\nOf fer Example : Y ou can also ‘go for the jugular ’ with your core\\nof fer and go straight for the sale. The direct path to money . W e\\nmodel our of fer from the last chapter .\\n \\n“I’m looking for 5 (specific avatar) to help achieve (dr eam\\noutcome) in (time delay). The best part is, you don’ t have to (effort\\nand sacrifice). And if you don’ t get (dr eam outcome), I will do two\\nthings (incr ease per ceived likelihood of achievement): 1) I will\\nhand you your money back 2) I will work with you until you do. I\\ndo this because I want everyone to have an amazing experience\\nwith us and because I’m confident I can deliver on my pr omise. If\\nthat sounds fair , DM me/book a call/comment below/r eply to this\\nemail/ etc.”\\n \\nAfter you make your ask, get back to providing value.\\n \\n*^This box is an example of an integration.\\n \\nAction Step One : Pick whether you integrate it or make an\\nintermittent ask. Then, pick whether you’ll advertise your core\\nof fer or lead magnet. If you’re not sure, do the lead magnet. It’ s\\nlower risk.\\n \\nHow to Scale It\\n \\n\\n \\nAfter you start asking, you’re gonna start getting leads and making\\nmoney . But you don\\'t want to stop there, do you? Didn’ t think so.\\nCool, so let’ s talk about scale.\\n \\nThere are two opposing strategies to scale your warm audience.\\nThey both follow progressive steps. First, you have the depth-then-\\nwidth approach. Then, you have the width-then-depth approach.\\nBoth are right. Here’ s how they work:\\n \\nDepth then width:  Maximize a platform, then move onto the next\\nplatform.\\n \\nStep #1:  Post content on a relevant platform.\\n \\nStep #2:  Post content regularly on that platform.\\n \\nStep #3 : Maximize quality and quantity of the content on that\\nplatform. Short form, you may sometimes be able to get up\\nto ten times per day per platform. Long form, you may have\\nto get up to five days per week (see soap operas).\\n \\nStep #4 : Add another platform while maintaining the quality and\\nquantity on the first platform.\\n \\nStep #5:  Repeat steps 1-4 until all relevant platforms are maximized.\\n \\nAdvantages : Once you figure out one platform, you maximize\\nyour return on that ef fort. Audiences compound faster the more\\nyou do. Y ou take advantage of this compounding. Fewer resources\\nare required to make this work.\\n \\nDisadvantages : Y ou have less low hanging fruit of new platforms\\nand new audiences. Y ou don’ t accomplish the feeling of\\n‘omnipresence.’ In the beginning, you risk your business being\\nreliant on a single channel. This is a risk because platforms change\\nall the time and sometimes ban you for no reason. If you only have\\none way to get customers, it can kill your business if it gets shut\\ndown.\\n \\nW idth then depth :  Get on every platform early , then maximize\\nthem together .\\n \\nStep #1:  Post content on a relevant platform.\\n \\nStep #2:  Post content regularly on that platform.\\n \\nStep #3:  Her e’ s wher e this strategy differs fr om the one befor e.\\nInstead of maximizing your first platform. Move onto the\\nnext relevant platform while maintaining the previous.\\n \\nStep #4:  Continue until you are on all relevant platforms.\\n \\nStep #5:  Now , maximize your content creation on all platforms at\\nonce.\\n \\nAdvantages : Y ou reach a broader audience faster . And, you can\\n“repurpose” your content. So with a little extra work, you can\\ncapture tons of ef ficiency . W ith minimal changes to the format,\\nyou can make the same content fit multiple platforms. For\\nexample, it takes little extra ef fort to format a single short video\\nacross all platforms distributing short video content.\\n \\nDisadvantages : It costs more labor , attention, and time, to do this\\nwell. Oftentimes, people end up with lots of bad content\\neverywhere. Sucky fluf f. No bueno.\\n \\nIf you already have a sizable business, scale up faster and reap the\\nrewards of an asset that only gets better with time. I said it before\\nand I’ll say it again. The best day to start posting content was the\\nday you were born. The second best day is today . Don’ t wait like I\\ndid.\\n \\n \\nAction Step : Pick an approach. Start posting. Then, go up the\\nscaling steps over time.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWhy Y ou Should Make Content (even if it’ s not your primary\\nadvertising strategy)\\n \\nJanuary 2020.\\n \\nI called all the major departments to a meeting to answer an\\nimportant question: Why isn’ t our paid advertising working like it\\nused to? Opinions flooded the room. “The creative…the copy…the\\nof fer…our pages…our sales process…our price…” They shot back\\nand forth at each other , every bit as invested as I was in solving the\\nproblem.\\n \\nLeila and I sat quietly as the team debated. After the din died\\ndown, Leila, in her wise fashion, asked a dif ferent question: What\\ndid we stop  doing in the months befor e the decline ?\\n \\nA new debate arose and a unanimous answer surfaced: Alex\\nstopped making gym content and started talking about general\\nbusiness. Now , I didn’ t know how important that was, but I had to\\nfind out. So, I sent a survey to our gym owners. I asked if they had\\nconsumed any content of mine befor e  they booked a call. The\\nresults astounded me.\\n \\n78% of all clients had consumed at least TWO long form pieces of\\ncontent, prior to booking a call.\\n \\nI had fallen into my old ways and given paid ads all the credit. But,\\nour free content was nurturing the demand. Don’ t make the same\\nmistake I did. Y our free content gives strangers an opportunity to\\nfind, get value from, and share your stuf f. And, it warms people on\\nthe fence that go to and come from the cold audience methods we\\ndive into next. So even if it’ s hard to measure, free content gets\\nyou better returns on all advertising methods.\\n \\nBottom line:  Start making content relevant to your audience. It\\nwill make you more money .\\n \\n7 Lessons I’ve Learned Fr om Making Content\\n \\n1)  Switch fr om “How to” to “How I.” Fr om “This is the best way”\\nto “These ar e my favorite ways” etc. (especially when starting\\nout). T alk about what you’ve done, not what others should do.\\nWhat you like, not this is the  best. When you talk about experience,\\nno one can question you. This makes you bulletproof.\\n \\na)   I make my oatmeal this way vs. you should make your\\noatmeal this way .\\n \\nb)  How I Built My 7-Figure Agency vs. How T o Build a 7-\\nFigure Agency .\\n \\nc)   My favorite way to generate leads for my business vs. This is\\nthe best way to generate leads for your business.\\n \\nIt’ s subtle. But when you tell your experience, you are sharing\\nvalue. When you tell a stranger what to do, it\\'s hard to avoid\\ncoming of f preachy or arrogant. This helps avoid it.\\n \\n2)  W e Need T o Be Reminded Mor e Than W e Need T o Be T aught:\\nY ou’re a silly goose if you think 100 percent of your audience\\nlistens 100 percent of the time.  For example, I post about my book\\nevery single day . I surveyed my audience and asked them if they\\nknew I had a book. One in five that saw the post said they didn’ t\\nknow . Keep repeating yourself. Y ou’ll get bored of your content\\nbefore your whole audience even sees it.\\n \\n3)  Puddles, Ponds, Lakes, Oceans. Narrow the focus of your content.\\nIf you have a small local business, you probably shouldn’ t make\\ngeneral business content. Not at first, at least. Why? The audience\\nwill listen to people with better track records than you. But you can\\nnarrow your topics to what you do and the place you do it.\\nExample: plumbing in a certain town. If you do that, you can\\nbecome king of that puddle. Over time, you can expand your\\nplumbing puddle to the general local business pond. Then the lake\\nof brick & mortar chains and so forth. Then eventually , the ocean\\nof general business.\\n \\n4)  Content Cr eates T ools For Salespeople . Some content will\\nperform well and get more people interested in buying your stuf f.\\nThat content helps your sales team . Create a master list of your\\n“greatest hits.” Label each ‘hit’ with the problem it solves and the\\nbenefit it provides. Then, your sales team can send it before or after\\nsales calls and help people decide to buy . They work especially\\nwell if the content resolves specific concerns prospects commonly\\nface.\\n \\n5)  Fr ee Content Retains Paying Customers . How a customer gets\\nvalue from you matters less than where they got it. Imagine a\\nperson pays for your thing and then consumes your free content. If\\nyour free content is valuable, they will like you more and stay loyal\\nto your business longer . On the flip side, if they consume your free\\ncontent, and it sucks, they will like your paid product less. Here’ s\\nsomething you may not know .  Somebody who buys your stuf f is\\nmor e likely  to consume your free content. This is why it’ s so\\nimportant to make your free content good - your customers will\\ninclude it in how they calculate their ROI from your paid thing.\\n \\n6)  People don\\'t have shorter attention spans, they have higher\\nstandards. Repeated for emphasis: ther e’ s no such thing as too\\nlong, only too boring.  Streaming platforms have proven that people\\nwill spend hours binging long form content if  they like  it . Our\\nbiology hasn\\'t changed, our circumstances have. They have more\\nrewarding stuf f to choose from. So make good stuf f people like and\\nreap the rewards rather than whining about people’ s “short\\nattention spans.”\\n \\n7)  A void Pr e-Scheduling Posts . The posts I manually post perform\\nbetter than ones I pre-schedule. Here’ s my theory . When you\\nmanually post, you know that within seconds you will be rewarded\\nor punished for the quality of the content. Because of that close\\nfeedback loop, you try *that much harder* to make it better . When\\nI schedule stuf f out, I don’ t feel that same pressure. So whenever I\\npost, or my team does, we strongly believe in someone pressing the\\n‘submit’ button because it gives that last bit of pressure to get it\\nright. T ry it.\\n \\n \\nBenchmarks - How W ell Am I Doing?\\n \\nIf our audience grows, we did good. But if our audience grows\\nfast, we did gooder . So I like to measure my audience size and\\nspeed of growth monthly .\\n \\nHere’ s what I measure:\\n \\n1)  T otal followers and reach - How big\\n \\na)   Follower Example: If I go from 1000 followers across\\nall platforms to 1500, I grew my audience by 500. \\n \\nb)  Reach Example: If I go from 10,000 people seeing my\\nstuf f to 15,000 people seeing my stuf f, I grew my r each\\nby 5,000 people.\\n \\n2)  Rate of getting followers and reach - How fast\\n \\nY ou compare the growth between months:\\n \\na)   Example: If I gained those 500 followers in a month,\\nthat would make it a 50% growth month. (500 New /\\n1000 Started = 50% growth rate).\\n \\nb)  Example: If I reached those 5000 extra people in a\\nmonth, that would make it a 50% growth month. (5000\\nNew / 10,000 Started = 50% growth rate)\\n \\nRemember , we can only control inputs. Measuring outputs is only\\nuseful if we are consistent with inputs. So, pick the posting\\ncadence you want to stick with on a particular platform. Then pick\\nyour ‘ask’ cadence on that platform (how you will direct people to\\nbecome engaged leads). Then, start, and…Do. Not. Stop.\\n \\n \\nFor reference, I posted a new podcast twice a week for four years\\nbefore even getting picked up on the T op 100 list. Because I did\\nthe same thing every week for years, I knew I could trust the\\nfeedback. In the beginning, it didn\\'t grow much. It took time for\\nme to get better . And I knew I had to make more, over a long time,\\nfor that to happen.\\n \\nSo if your listeners go from ten to fifteen in a month, that’ s\\nprogress baby! Even with small absolute numbers, that’ s fifty\\npercent monthly growth! It’ s why I like to measure both the\\nabsolute and relative growth and pick the one that makes me feel\\nbetter (ha!). As my friend Dr . Kashey says, “The more ways you\\nmeasure, the more ways you can win.” Be consistent. Measure a\\nlot. Adapt to feedback. Be a winner .\\n \\nT o close the loop, in its fifth year , my podcast- The Game ,  became\\na T op 10 podcast in the US for business and top 500 in the world.\\nThis was only possible after 5 years of multiple podcasts per week\\nevery week .

So the first post you make, you can\\nmake an ask.  My hope is that it gets you your first engaged lead.

If someone\\nwon’ t speak at your funeral, you shouldn’ t care about their opinion\\nwhile you’re alive. Honor the few who believe in you by having\\ncourage.\\n \\n \\nWhenever I read this, I just think “you goon.” But hey , I was\\ntrying.

Nothing’ s stopping you.\\n \\n \\nSo What Do I Do Right Now?\\n \\nPosting free content is less predictable than, but complementary to,\\nwarm reach outs. So keep doing warm r each outs. Also, posting\\nfree content grows your warm audience. And a bigger warm\\naudience means more people for warm reach outs. So free content\\ngets engaged leads on its own and keeps getting  engaged leads\\nthrough warm reach outs. Instead of ditching one for the other , I\\nrecommend you post free content in addition to  warm reach outs.\\n \\nLet’ s fill out our daily action commitment for our first platform.\\n \\n \\n \\nNext Up\\n \\nFirst, we start with warm outreach. W e reach out to every person\\nwe have permission to contact. Second, we post publicly about the\\nsuccesses and lessons we have from our first clients. W e post\\ntestimonials. W e provide value. Then occasionally ask. W e commit\\nto doing both of these activities every day .\\n \\nW ith these two methods alone can eventually build a six- or seven-\\nfigure business. But you may want to go faster . So we venture from\\nwarm audiences who know us, to cold audiences who don’ t. W e\\nbegin r eaching out to strangers . This begins the third step in our\\nadvertising journey: cold outreach.\\n \\n \\n\\nF r e e  G o o d w i l l\\n \\n“He who said money can’ t buy happiness hasn’ t given enough\\naway .” – Unknown\\n \\n \\nPeople who give without expectation live longer , happier lives  and\\nmake more money .

In a matter of months, thirty percent of my\\ncustomers went out of business. Protestors filled every platform\\nwith hate and anger . Politicians made promises. Small businesses\\nsuf fered in silence. Unemployment skyrocketed. The most\\ntumultuous election ever was upon us. And here we were, trying to\\ngenerate leads to pay our bills. Employees everywhere, and their\\nfamilies, depended on it.\\n \\nAll three of my companies at the time (Gym Launch, Prestige\\nLabs, and ALAN) relied on brick-and-mortar businesses staying\\nopen. And, they were closed. Brilliant strategy Alex . T o make\\nmatters worse, Apple did a software update that crippled our ads.\\nThe market was crap. Our paid ads were crap. And I carried the\\nbucket.\\n \\nI ran through worst-case scenarios. How much cash would it take\\nto keep us afloat? How long do I keep paying people when ther e’ s\\nno end in sight? Should I dip into personal accounts? Give up a\\nthir d of my life savings? Half? All of it? What does that say about\\nme?  I had no idea what to do.\\n \\nEarly that Satur day morning…\\n \\nI tried to sleep long enough for my alarm to wake me, but it was no\\nuse. I went to my of fice and checked Instagram. I had a new\\nmessage waiting for me:\\n \\n“Hey Alex - Cale told me you guys don’ t need salesmen anymor e,\\nso my offer got pulled. I quit my job to accept it. Super honor ed\\nyou consider ed me. I hope you’ll consider me again the next time\\nyou have openings.”\\n \\nLooking for context, I scrolled up. Reading our earlier messages\\nrewarded me with a pang of guilt. I was the one who told him to\\napply . He took the rejection well. A sign of a good salesman . I felt\\nobligated to reply .\\n \\n“Y ou on?” I messaged.\\n \\n“Y es,” he replied.\\n \\n“Got 5?”\\n \\n“Y es”\\n \\nW e hopped on a call. He sounded a little nervous, but I could tell\\nhe knew his stuf f. It sucks we don’ t have enough leads for this\\nguy…\\n \\n“I’ve wanted to work for you a while now . I read your book and\\nused the scripts to become the top producer at my company ,” he\\nsaid.\\n \\n“That’ s awesome. I’m so glad to hear it. What kind of company?” I\\nasked.\\n \\n“A gym software company .”\\n \\nI hadn’ t hear d of them . “Oh interesting. How do you guys get\\nleads?”\\n \\n“W e’re 100% cold outreach.”\\n \\n“Y ou cold call and cold email gyms, then sell them software?”\\n \\n“Y ea, pretty much.”\\n \\n“How big is the team?”\\n \\n“W e’ve got about thirty guys.”\\n \\nA team of 30!?  “What’ s your revenue like if you can share that\\nwith me.”\\n \\n“W e’re doing about $10,000,000 per month now .”\\n \\nInsane.  “Just from cold outreach?”\\n \\n“Y ea, we run some ads, but we haven’ t cracked that yet.”\\n \\n“And you do this with a retention of fer? Y ou’re not even really\\nmaking gyms more money?”\\n \\n“Y ea, it\\'s definitely not as easy to sell as the stuf f you do for\\ngyms.”\\n \\n“Do you think you could use the same cold outreach system here?”\\n \\n“I’ve never started a team, but I bet I could figure it out.”\\n \\n“Alright. What was the of fer Cale pulled?”\\n \\n“I was gonna be a closer , but he said you guys didn\\'t need one\\nanymore.”\\n \\nI thought for a moment. “W ell, given our current lead volume, he’ s\\nprobably right. But, if you can get your own leads , I’ll give you the\\nrunway to get cold outreach going. What do you think?”\\n \\n“It takes a while to get going. I’ll have to figure out the scripts for\\nyour of fer .”\\n \\n“Y eah, that makes sense. How long, you think?”\\n \\n“I’m confident I could make it profitable in twelve weeks.”\\n \\n“Alright, deal. I’ll let Cale know the plan. T o be clear , you’ll be\\nexpected to figure all this out. The software. The lists. Everything.\\nI’ll front you the time, but we can’ t support you much beyond\\nthat.”\\n \\n“Understood.”\\n \\nHere’ s what happened during the months that followed:\\n \\nSeptember: 0 Sales. Zippola. Nothin’. Zilch. Nada.\\n \\nOctober: 2 Sales ($32,000 in revenue) T eam asks me to pull the\\nplug on cold outreach.\\n \\nDecember: 4 Sales ($64,000 in revenue) T eam asks me to pull the\\nplug, again.\\n \\nJanuary: 6 Sales ($96,000 in revenue)\\n \\nFebruary: 10 Sales ($160,000 in revenue)\\n \\nMarch: 14 Sales ($224,000 in revenue)\\n \\nApril: 20 Sales ($320,000 in revenue)\\n \\nMay: 30 Sales ($480,000 in revenue)\\n \\nT oday: Cold outreach generates millions per month for our\\nbusinesses\\n \\nMaking this work took every (legal) cold outreach method we\\nknew . Cold calls….Cold emails….Cold Direct\\nMessages….V oicemails. Everything. But, piece by piece, we built\\na reliable customer -getting machine. I wanted something that\\nwould endur e .\\n \\nAnd that’ s what I’m gonna show you how to build.\\n \\n \\nI learned five important lessons fr om this experience:\\n \\n1) There was another company in my space making a lot  more\\nmoney than mine. It broke my belief about how big the market\\nreally was.\\n \\n2) They made all their money through private  advertising. I had no\\nway of knowing they existed unless they contacted me first. So,\\nthey kind of operated in secret.\\n \\n3) They built a very profitable cold outreach machine in my  space.\\nIf they could do it, so could I.\\n \\n4) It’ s good to have proper expectations. Cold outreach veterans\\ntold me it would take a year to scale. I figured we could do it in\\ntwelve weeks. I was wrong. It took almost a year . Cold outreach\\ntakes a long time. At least, it did for me.\\n \\n5) W e tried cold outreach two times before and failed. W orking\\nwith a person that had done it all before was immensely helpful in\\ngetting this going. I hope to be that person for you now .\\n \\n \\nHow Cold Outr each W orks\\n \\n \\nAt some point, you’ll want one of two things. Either , you’ll want to\\ngrow faster than you currently are. Or , you’ll want to increase the\\npredictability of your lead flow…\\n \\nHere’ s how we can do that. W e advertise to people who don’ t\\nknow us. Cold audiences. And like before, we can contact them\\npublicly or privately . In this chapter , we focus on private one-to-\\none communication with cold outreach. For added context, cold\\noutreach sits atop the foundation of warm outreach. So think of this\\nas the more advanced cousin of warm outreach, no longer limited\\nby your warm audience.\\n \\nIf you can figure out a way to contact somebody one-to-one, you\\ncan use it for cold outreach. Y ou knock on 100 doors. Y ou make\\n100 phone calls. Y ou send 100 direct messages. Y ou send 100\\nvoicemails. All these are examples of cold outreach that have made\\ncompanies zillions. It worked 100 years ago. It works today . And\\nwhen the platforms change, it’ll work tomorrow .\\n \\nCold outreach has one key dif ference from warm outreach: trust.\\nStrangers don’ t trust you.\\n \\nAnd compared to people who know us, strangers present three  new\\nproblems.\\n \\n1)  First, you don\\'t have a way to contact them. Duh.\\n \\n2)  Second, even if you can contact them, they ignore you. \\n \\n3)  Third, even if they give you their attention, they’re not\\ninterested.\\n \\n \\nLet me describe what these problems look like in the real world.\\n \\nIf you’re knocking on doors , you don\\'t have the addresses. Then,\\neven if you do, they don\\'t open the door when you knock. If they\\nopen, they still tell you to pound sand.\\n \\nIf you’re making cold calls , you don\\'t have their phone numbers.\\nEven if you do, they don\\'t pick up. If they pick up, they hang up on\\nyou.\\n \\nIf you\\'re sending cold emails , you don’ t have their email addresses.\\nEven if you do, they don’ t open the email. Even if they do, they\\ndon’ t respond.\\n \\nIf you’re sending direct messages , you don’ t have a place to send\\nit. Even if you do, they don’ t read it. Even if they read it, they\\ndon’ t reply .\\n \\nIf you’re sending voice memos or text messages , you don’ t have\\ntheir numbers. Even if you do, they don’ t read or listen to it. Even\\nif they read or listen to it, they don’ t reply .\\n \\nNow that we got that out of the way , the order we solve these\\nproblems is:\\n \\n1)  Get a way to contact them\\n \\n2)  Figure out what to say\\n \\n3)  Contact them until they’re ready and able to listen \\n \\nThe Result . W e find lots of ways to contact the most qualified\\nstrangers. W e reach out to a lot of them in a lot of ways a lot of\\ntimes. Then, we overwhelm them with value upfront to get them to\\nshow enough interest to move forward.\\n \\n \\nCold outreach is a numbers game. The more people you reach out\\nto the more engaged leads you get. Once we figure out how much\\noutreach it takes to engage a lead, then we only have one thing to\\ndo… mor e . Let’ s go hunting!\\n \\nAs there are three new problems strangers introduce, I’ve divided\\nthis chapter into three steps. One step per problem. First, we get a\\ntar geted list of leads. Next, we need to know what to say to get\\nthem to reply . Third, we make up for a lower response rate by\\nincreasing the volume and type of our reach out attempts.\\n \\n \\nPr oblem #1: “But how do I contact them?”  →Build a List\\n \\n \\nUp until this point, from warm reach outs and posting free content,\\nyou’ve had to accept the leads that came to you from your warm\\naudience. No more. W ith cold outreach, unlike any other way of\\nadvertising, we get to be as specific as we want. Only want to talk\\nto hedge fund managers managing over $1B? Done. Y ou can do\\nthat. Only want to speak with golf apparel retail store owners over\\n$3M in sales? Done. Only want to talk to influencers who get over\\n50,000 unique page views per month? Done. Now we  get to pick\\nour tar gets rather than them picking us.\\n \\nNow , you probably don’ t have a way to reach out to 1000 perfect\\nfit strangers. And if we’re gonna get them to buy from us, we’ve\\ngotta first find a way to contact them– duh . So let’ s solve that\\nproblem first.\\n \\nThere are three dif ferent ways I get my tar geted lead lists. First, I\\nuse software to scrape a list of names. Second, I pay brokers to\\nassemble me a list of tar geted leads. And if neither of those work, I\\nmanually scrape a list of names myself. Here’ s the process.\\n \\nStep #1 Softwares : I subscribe to as many softwares as I can that\\nscrape leads from dif ferent sources. I search them all based on\\nmy criteria. The software then spits out names, job titles, contact\\ninformation, etc. I try out a representative sample, say a few\\nhundred from each software I use. Then, if the contact\\ninformation is up to date, the leads are responsive, and they are\\nthe type of person the software claims them to be, bingo! Then I\\nget as many leads as the software will give me. But if I can’ t\\nseem to find the right audience, I move onto step two.\\n \\nStep #2 Brokers : I go to multiple list brokers and ask them to\\nmake me a list based on my audience criteria. They then send\\nme a sample. I test out sample lists from each of the brokers. If I\\nget good results from one or more brokers, I stick with their\\nlists. And if I still can’ t find who I’m looking for , I move to step\\nthree.\\n \\nStep #3 Elbow Grease : I join groups and communities that I\\nthink have my audience. When I find people that meet my\\nqualifications, I check to see if they have ways to contact them\\nin the group’ s directory–like links to their social media profiles,\\netc.  If they do, I add them to my list. If they don’ t, I can reach\\nout to them within the platform hosting the group. I prefer to\\nfind contact information outside the group so I don’ t come of f as\\nsomeone solely trying to milk the group for business but I will if\\nI have to .\\n \\nSo I work my way from the most accessible leads to the least\\naccessible leads. Here’ s an important point. If you can search the\\ndatabase, so can everyone else. But if you assemble a list of names\\nyourself, it’ s less likely that person has already received many cold\\nreach outs from other companies. So they’re the freshest.\\nDownside: it takes the most time. Of course, you can pay someone\\nelse to do this for you once you figure it out for yourself, but we’re\\nonly talking about getting started in this chapter . W e’ll talk about\\nscaling in Section IV .\\n \\nAction Step:  Find your scraping tool by searching “outbound\\nleads scraping tool” or “database lead scraping.” Find brokers the\\nsame way . W ith a few clicks, you’ll find what you’re looking for .\\nPut your first 1000 names together . If you have more time than\\nmoney , you might want to start at step three since it only costs\\ntime.\\n \\n \\nPr oblem #2: “I have my list, but what do I say to them?”\\n→Personalize, Then Give Big Fast V alue\\n \\nNow that you have your list of leads, you gotta figure out what to\\nsay .  I went over a lot of scripting in the W arm Reach Outs section–\\nthis section builds on that one. At the end of this chapter , I also\\ninclude three sample scripts you can model for cold calls, cold\\nemails, and cold chat messaging. That being said, there are two\\nimportant factors I emphasize to get strangers to engage:\\npersonalization  and big fast value . This is important because they\\ndon\\'t know us and they don’ t trust us. W e’ve gotta overcome both\\nissues in a matter of seconds.\\n \\na) They Don’t Know Us→Personalize (Act Like Y ou Know Them).\\nT o get more leads to engage, we want the message to look  like it’ s\\nfrom someone they know . The best way to do that is to actually know\\nsomething about the person you are contacting. In essence, we want\\nour cold  reach out to look like a warm  reach out.\\n \\n…Imagine your phone rings from an unknown number and area code.\\nAre you likely to pick it up? Probably not. What about if the number\\nis from your area code? A little more likely . Why is that? Because it\\nmight be someone you know . So to take this concept further , imagine\\nyou pick up the phone...\\n \\n…The person says “<Y our name?>” then pausing (like a normal\\nperson). Y ou’d say , “yea…who’ s this?” Now , if that person then went\\non to say , “it’ s Alex… then pauses …I watched a few of your videos\\nand read that recent blog post you wrote on dog training. It was killer!\\nReally helped me out with my doberman. She’ s a beast! That peanut\\nbutter trick really helped. Thanks for that.”\\n \\nY ou’d still be wondering what’ s going on. But you know what you\\nwouldn’ t be doing?… hanging up . Then you hear , “Oh yea, sorry , I got\\nahead of myself. I work for a company that helps dog trainers fill up\\ntheir books. W e like to partner with the best in the area. So I’m always\\non the lookout. W e worked with someone about an hour north from\\nyou…John’ s Doggy Daycare…heard of them?”\\n \\nY ou’d respond yes or no (it doesn’ t matter), and they’d say , “Y ea, we\\nended up getting them 100 appointments in 30 days using a\\ncombination of text email and some ads. Do you of fer similar services\\nto them?” T o which you’d probably say yes. Then they’d say , “Oh\\nthat’ s perfect. Then we’d be able to use that same campaign in your\\nmarket and drive leads over to you. If you got a boatload of high\\npaying new dog training customers you wouldn’ t be upset with me\\nwould you?” Y ou’d laugh lightly . “Okay great. W ell…tell ya what…I\\ncan walk you through the entire thing soup to nuts later today . W ill\\nyou be around at 4?” And you’d say - sure - or whatever . The point is,\\nif that person had started the call with “hey man, wanna buy some\\nmarketing services?” you’d probably have hung up.\\n \\nPersonalization  is what gets your foot in the door to get the sale.\\nBasically one to three pieces of information we can find that a friend\\nmight know about the prospect. Then we want to complement them on\\nit, and ideally , show them how it benefited us. People like people who\\nlike them. Even if someone doesn’ t know you, they’ll give you more\\ntime if you know something about them.\\n \\nThis comes in handy for personal subject lines on emails, the first few\\nmessages in chat, or the first few sentences someone hears. Even if\\nsomeone doesn’ t know you, they will appreciate the time you took to\\nresearch them before contacting them. This tiny ef fort goes a long\\nway .\\n \\nAction step: Do a little research on each lead before you send\\nthem a message. W e can do this ourselves, pay people to do it for\\nus, or use software. Batch this work. Then, use your notes to figure\\nout the first thing you’ll open with to feel mor e familiar .\\n \\n \\nb) They Don’t T rust Us→Big Fast V alue.  The key dif ference between\\npeople who know you and strangers is…strangers give you far less\\ntime to prove your worth. And, they need a lot more incentive to\\nmove towards you. So make your life easier by “giving away the\\nfarm.” W e’re not trying to tickle their interest, we’re trying to blow\\ntheir minds in under thirty seconds .\\n \\nLike warm reach outs, you can directly make your of fer , or of fer a\\nlead magnet, or both. It gives the person a strong reason to respond.\\n \\nI specifically call out ‘big fast value’ rather than “your lead magnet”\\nas a reminder that it needs to be BIG F AST V ALUE. If it’ s not, or it’ s\\nmediocre, you’ll blend in with the ocean of people trying to get their\\nattention. And they’ll treat you the same–they’ll ignore you. Here’ s\\nhow much it matters:\\n \\nThe first four months of cold outreach felt like torture. W e of fered a\\ngame planning session as our lead magnet. Some gyms took us up on\\nit, but most didn’ t. W e needed something better . I tested many parts of\\nour process but swapping the lead magnet blew everything else out of\\nthe water . W e swapped from “game planning” - code for “sales call” - \\nto actually giving them as much free service as we could possibly\\naf ford. Our take rates 3x’d and cold outreach became a monster\\nchannel for us.\\n \\nIf your of fer/lead magnet isn’ t working for you, up the ante. Keep\\nof fering more until you make it so good they feel stupid saying no .\\nThey either buy from you or have nice things to say about you. W in-\\nwin.\\n \\nIf you for get everything about this chapter , remember one thing: the\\ngoal is to  demonstrate big value as fast as possible .  Give yourself a\\ndownhill battle by giving away something crazy . Give away\\nsomething for free people would normally pay for and they will want\\nit. Note: I didn’ t say , “so good they should pay for it,” I said, “stuf f\\nthey actually pay for .” Big dif ference. T ake this to heart and your\\nresults will show it.\\n \\nAction Step: Provide the biggest fastest value  you can af ford to\\nwith your lead magnet or of fer . Then, write your scripts. And don’ t\\nworry , I got your back there. T o give you a headstart, I provide\\nsample phone, email, and direct message scripts at the end of the\\nchapter . Note: Phone and chat scripts are never more than a page or\\ntwo, and cold emails rarely more than half a page. So don’ t\\noverthink it. There are no awards for prettiest script. Get your first\\n100 conversations or 10,000 emails out of the way before tweaking\\nit. Get testing. Then tweak as you learn.\\n \\n \\nPr oblem #3: “I’m not getting enough chances to tell people\\nabout my amazing stuff, what do I do?”  → V olume\\n \\nOnce we have our list of names, personal info, and our big sexy\\nlead magnet, we need to get more strangers to see it. W e do this in\\nthree ways. First, we automate delivery to the greatest extent\\npossible. Next, we automate distribution to the greatest extent\\npossible. Finally , we follow up more times in more ways.\\n \\na) Automated Delivery .  T o the extent that we can, automating delivery\\nunlocks huge scale as someone doesn’ t need to literally communicate\\nthe message to the prospect. This means you get more engaged leads\\nper unit of time (even if fewer engage by overall percentage).\\nRemember , you have far more people who don’ t know you than\\npeople who do. So you don’ t have to worry as much  about ‘burning\\nthrough an audience.’ Here’ s what the dif ference between manual and\\nautomated delivery looks like.\\n \\n \\nManual Examples : A live person can say a script to someone over the\\nphone. Y ou can send a personal voice memo to each lead. A person\\ncan write a handwritten letter to every person on the list. If it takes a\\nperson time to convey the message each time, it’ s manual.\\n \\n \\nAutomated Examples : W e can send a pre-recorded voice memo to\\nsomeone’ s direct messages. W e can send a pre-recorded voicemail to\\nsomeone’ s voicemail box. W e can send templated emails to an inbox\\nor a templated text to someone’ s phone. W e can send a pre-recorded\\nvideo. Etc. Y ou record your message one time and then send the same\\nmessage to everyone.\\n \\n \\nb) Automate Distribution . Once we have our messages prepared, we\\ngotta distribute them. And there’ s no award for who works the\\nhardest, only for who gets the best results. Although one leads to the\\nother . And as you build your skills, you will find ways to automate\\nportions of the work. I encourage you to automate when ethical and\\navailable.\\n \\n \\nManual examples : Dial each phone number . Click send on each email,\\ndirect message, text, etc.\\nAutomated examples : Use a robot to dial multiple numbers at a time.\\nSend a blast of 1000 emails, texts, voicemails at one time. Etc.\\n \\nGenerally speaking, you sacrifice personalization for scale. Y ou get\\na higher response rate with personalized messages. The fewer leads\\nyou have, the less automation you should use.\\n \\nFor example, if there are only 1000 hedge fund managers who\\nmeet your criteria, you’re gonna wanna personalize every one of\\nthem. On the other hand, if you’re tar geting women 25-45 trying to\\nlose weight, there are tens of millions of them. So you can get\\naway with less personalization. But…if you personalize…you’ll\\nget even more (wink).\\n \\n \\nAction Step. Embrace new technology . Allocate ten to twenty\\npercent of your ef fort towards brand new untested technology . For\\nexample, if you make phone calls five days per week, try out a new\\ndialer or tech one of the days and see how it does compared to your\\nstandard dialer .\\n \\nc) Follow up. Mor e times. Mor e ways.  There are two more ways you\\ncan get more from your list of names.\\n \\n \\nFirst, you try to contact them more than once. Shocker . But wanna\\nknow something crazy , most people don’ t. Here’ s a dif ferent way to\\nthink about it. Imagine you really needed to get a hold of your parents\\nbecause something important came up. What would you do? Y ou’d\\nprobably call them, text them, leave a voicemail, etc. And if they still\\nhaven’ t responded, what would you do? Y ou\\'d call and text them\\nagain (probably shortly thereafter). It\\'s the same way with prospects.\\nThey are in danger of living life without your solution. Be a hero.\\nSave them!\\n \\nThe more ways you try to contact someone, the more likely you are to\\ncontact them. People respond to dif ferent methods. For example, I\\nnever respond to phone calls. But, I reply to direct messages far more.\\n \\nContacting someone multiple times multiple ways shows them you\\nare serious. And doing so quickly communicates you have something\\nimportant to discuss. Curiosity increases because they fear they\\'re\\nmissing out.\\n \\nPersonally , I like to email first. Y ou know why? Because most people\\ndon’ t respond. If someone doesn’ t respond to one of your reach out\\nmethods, use that as a reason to follow up with another method. “Hey\\nI’m calling you to follow up about my email.”  W e either get a\\nresponse or a real reason to reach out again. W e win either way .\\n \\nAnd once you do get them booked for an appointment, expect more\\nthan one conversation. Remember ,  we’re contacting complete\\nstrangers. Outreach takes more touch points with people who don’ t\\nknow you. So expect two to three conversations before a higher ticket\\nsale. Shoot for less, but expect more when you start out.\\n \\nBottom line : Act like you’re actually  trying to get ahold of these\\npeople, rather than going through the motions, and you probably\\nwill.\\n \\nAction Step: Contact each lead multiple times in multiple ways.\\n \\n \\nSecond, once you finish contacting your list, start back at the top\\nagain. This actually works for three reasons .\\n \\nOne, because they simply may not have seen your first series of\\nmessages. Only a fool would think one hundred percent of people\\nsee what you put out one hundred percent of the time. So we make\\nup for that discrepancy with follow up.\\n \\nT wo, even if they do see it, it may not have been a good moment to\\nrespond.  People\\'s schedules change every day . And there are times\\nwhen people can’ t respond to you even if they wanted to. So the\\nmore opportunities you give them to respond, the greater the\\nchance they will.\\n \\nThree, their circumstances may have changed. They might not\\nhave needed you then, but need you desperately now . Imagine a\\nperson you message about losing weight before the holidays. At\\nthat time, they fit into their ‘skinny’ jeans, so they feel no pain.\\nThey probably wouldn’ t respond. But after they gained ten lbs over\\nthe holidays, they may all of a sudden be in desperate need of what\\nyou of fer . And now , they respond to your reach out attempt. The\\nonly thing that changed was their circumstance. So try again in\\nthree to six months and get an entirely new group of engaged leads\\nfr om the same list .\\n \\nEverything may be right except the timing. So the more times we\\ncontact them, the more likely we will catch them at the time\\nthey’re ready to engage.\\n \\nAction Step. After you’ve attempted to contact them multiple\\ntimes, multiple ways, wait three to six months. Then, do it again.\\n \\n \\n \\nThr ee Pr oblems Strangers Cr eate→Solved\\n \\nI wrote the book in this order to build on itself. Start with warm\\nreach outs. Get some reps. Post some content to grow your warm\\naudience. Get even more reps. Then, you’ll be ready for cold reach\\nouts.\\n \\nAnd now , we solved the three core problems cold audiences create:\\nfinding the right list of people, getting them to pay attention to you,\\nand getting them to engage. V ictory!\\n \\n \\n \\nBenchmarks–How well am I doing?\\n \\nThe two times I failed at cold outreach I hired people who never\\ntracked metrics well. The third person did. And cold reach outs\\nsucceeded. The person who runs it (maybe you) has to know the\\nmetrics of the sales process like the back of their hand. Every\\nsingle stat.\\n \\nLet’ s break down the numbers with a couple platform examples. I\\ncannot give an example for every platform because it would take\\ntoo long. My hope is that you can generalize the concept to\\nwhatever platform you use.\\n \\n \\nPhone Example\\n \\nLet’ s say I make 100 cold calls per day . And, let’ s say I get a\\ntwenty percent pick-up rate. From there, I am able to get twenty-\\nfive percent of people to want to take my lead magnet. That means\\nI got four engaged leads. If it took me four hours to make those\\ncalls, it means I got one engaged lead per hour . I can do this at\\nfirst. Once the amount of engaged leads that convert to customers\\nmakes me more than it costs to pay a cold outreach rep–I teach\\nsomeone else to do it for me (more on this in Section IV). So you\\nknow you do well when you make at least thr ee times  the lifetime\\nprofit of a customer compared to what it costs you to get them.\\n \\nEmail Example\\n \\nLet’ s say you send 100 personalized emails per day . From there,\\nthirty percent open our email. From there, 10% reply showing\\ninterest. That means we’d have three engaged leads (30% x 10% =\\n3%). The numbers will vary but shoot for 3% of your list turning\\ninto engaged leads . Here’ s a sample from a new campaign for a\\nvery niche high ticket service business in our portfolio. It shows a\\n4% lead engagement rate. And presumably , a third of them convert\\ninto sales. That would net us one new customer per one hundred\\noutreach attempts.\\n \\n \\nDirect Message Example\\n \\nLet’ s say I make a personal video or record a personal voice memo\\nfor one hundred people. I say their name and add one personal line\\nbefore delivering my standard message. From there, twenty percent\\nof people reply . W e now have twenty engaged leads. From there\\nwe use the same A-C-A format from the warm outreach section to\\nqualify them for a call and so forth. So like the phone example,\\nyou know you do well when the cost of doing cold outreach is less\\nthan three times what you make in profit from a customer . Note:\\nY ou can do W A Y better than three times, that’ s the bare minimum.\\nFor context, the portfolio company above gets over 30:1 returns\\nfrom its outreach ef forts.\\n \\n \\nCosts\\n \\nThis method is labor intensive. Nearly all costs are in the form of\\nlabor . In order to calculate our return on advertising, we add up all\\nlabor and software costs associated with steps one through three in\\nthe section before last.\\n \\nLet’ s imagine we have a team doing cold calls:\\n \\nW e pay them $15 per hour and $50 per shown appointment or\\n“shows.” \\n \\nW e have $3600 in profit per sale.\\n \\nLeads cost us ten cents.  \\n \\nThey call 200 leads per day . \\n \\nW e would likely get about two shows per day from one rep. \\n \\nIf they worked eight hours per day , we would pay $120 in labor\\nand $100 in show commissions per rep and $20 for the leads. \\n \\nThis means we would pay $240 for two shows or $120 per\\nshow . \\n \\nIf we closed 33% of shows, our cost to get a client (excluding\\ncommissions) would be $360. \\n \\nSince we get $3600 profit per new client, we would make a 10:1\\nreturn.\\n \\nThat’ s how cold outreach works. Then, you just add bodies. It is\\nboring and tedious, but brutally ef fective.\\n \\n \\n \\nThis Sounds Hard, Why Bother?\\n \\nMost people dramatically underestimate the amount of volume it\\ntakes to use cold outreach. They also underestimate how long it\\ntakes. But there are seven enormous  benefits to using cold\\noutreach:\\n \\n1)  Y ou don’ t need to create lots of content or ads . Y ou focus only on\\none perfectly crafted message you convey to all your prospects.\\nY our only goal is to make that one message better every day . There\\nis no ‘ad fatigue’ or ‘banner blindness’ since your prospects have\\nnever seen anything from you. So, you don\\'t need to be a marketing\\ngenius to make this work.\\n \\n2)  Y our competition won’ t know what you’re doing . Everything is\\nprivate. By that fact alone, you can continue to operate in secrecy .\\nY ou are not educating your competitors about how you acquire\\ncustomers. They don’ t know what you\\'re doing, or even, that you\\nexist.\\n \\n3)  It’ s incredibly reliable . All you have to do to get more is do more.\\nA certain amount of input creates a certain number of responses. It\\nbecomes like clockwork, bringing a reliable flow of new engaged\\nleads into your world. Y ou can reverse engineer the amount of sales\\nyou want to make to the number of inputs at the top of your lead\\npathway . Eventually you’ll have an equation: for every X people\\ncontacted, you get Y customers. Then, you simply solve for X.\\n \\nEx: Let’ s say for every 100 emails, I get one customer . If I want\\n100 customers, I need to send 10,000 emails. That’ s 333 per day .\\nOne person can send 1 1 1 emails a day . Therefore, I need three\\npeople sending emails every day to get 100 customers per\\nmonth.\\n \\n4)  Fewer platform changes . Private communication is rarely subject to\\nplatform changes. Whereas public platforms change rules and\\nalgorithms every day . Y ou gotta stay on top of rule changes to\\nremain ef fective. In contrast, rules for cold calling, door knocking,\\nand cold email have hardly changed in thirty years.\\n \\n5)  Compliance is less painful . Many platforms have stringent rules\\naround claims you can make about the stuf f you sell. Some also\\nban certain industries altogether (tobacco, firearms, cannabis,\\nweight loss, etc.). W ith cold outreach, you don\\'t need to deal with\\nany of this. Y ou still need to be FTC compliant, but you don’ t also\\nneed to worry about platform rules on top. This makes life easier . If\\nyou have a phone, you can make money . If you have an email\\naccount, you can get leads. This makes you very hard to stop.\\n \\n6)  No spokesperson = Sellable business . If an investor can buy it from\\nyou without worrying your business will stop getting customers if\\nyou leave….your business is far  more valuable. Having an\\nestablished outreach team is how we were able to sell Gym\\nLaunch. The business could grow without me dancing in front of\\nthe camera or relying on me being super ridiculously good looking\\n(ha!). I don’ t think they would have wanted to buy us without it, or\\nat least, not for as much.\\n \\n7)  Hard to copy .  Even if someone wants to copy your entire cold\\noutreach system, they’ll often need to learn how to do each step.\\nAnd, many steps are invisible. They don\\'t know how you scrape\\nyour lists. They don\\'t know how you personalize your messages.\\nThey don’ t know what softwares you use to distribute the messages\\netc. On top of that, they’d still need to learn how to hire, train, and\\noperate a team of people who can do each step. Once you have a\\nhead start, it compounds with time. It becomes very hard to catch\\nyou.\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nY our T urn\\n \\nIf you recall our advertising checklist this kicks of f your journey to\\nget more engaged leads with cold outreach. Y ou start this as you\\nrun out of people to advertise to, or , because you just want more.\\nHere’ s a sample.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNext Up\\n \\nNow that you have set your commitment for this cold outreach\\nmethod, we move onto the last thing a single person can do to\\nadvertise: run paid ads.\\n \\n \\n \\n# 4  R u n  P a i d  A d s  P a r t  I :  M a k i n g  A n  A d\\nHow T o Publicly Advertise to Strangers\\n \\nAdvertising is the only casino wher e, with enough skill, you\\nbecome the house.\\n \\n \\nJune 2013.\\n \\n“Let’ s try some Facebook ads for the gym.” I spouted.\\n \\nSam’ s eyebrow went up. “They don’ t work. I already tried.”\\n \\nNow this was the brief time between quitting my “real job” and\\nstarting my first gym. I wanted some experience. So I cold-emailed\\nmore than 40 gym owners for a chance to shadow them. Sam was\\nthe only one who responded to my pleas for mentorship. He let me\\nwork at his gym, with him , for minimum wage. I’m forever\\ngrateful for that opportunity .\\n \\n“I promise, I really think they’ll work.” I said. “Let me give it a\\nshot with the stuf f I learned from that workshop last weekend. I’ll\\ndo everything.” That workshop took most of my puny savings.\\n \\nSam leaned back in his chair , crossing his arms. “I’ll tell you what.\\nI’ll give you a thousand bucks to play with. If you lose it, then you\\nhave to shut up about this Facebook stuf f. If you make more, I’ll\\nsplit the profit with you.”\\n \\n“Deal.”\\n \\nI worked with a freelancer to get everything set up. W e went back\\nand forth until it was “perfect.” A few days later , I marched into\\nSam’ s of fice to show him what I’d made.\\n \\n“It’ s ready .” I said.\\n \\nHe spun his laptop to face me. “Alright, Hormozi. Show me what\\nyou’ve got.”\\n \\nI placed the ugliest ad you’ve ever seen:\\n \\nI’M LOOKING FOR 5 CHINO HILLS RESIDENTS T O T AKE\\nPLACE IN A FREE 6 WEEK CHALLENGE. YOU MUST LET\\nUS USE YOUR BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES IN OUR\\nMARKETING IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PROGRAM. CLICK\\nLINK T O SIGN UP:\\n[LINK]\\n \\nNo images. No videos. No frills. →Just words. ALL CAPS.\\n \\nThe ad went live.\\n \\nW e got leads within hours. I called them all and booked\\nappointments as fast as I could. I also texted them about an hour\\nbefore to remind them of our appointment. And as soon as they\\nwalked in, I started yapping about our six week challenge. I had\\nzero sales skills. My conviction made up for my lack of skill. They\\nbought.\\n \\nI sold 19 people at $299 each. W e made just under $5700 from the\\n$1000 investment. T rue to his word, Sam cut me a check and\\nhanded it over . He made it out for $2500. More than my share.\\n \\n“Sam, this is–”\\nHe cut me of f. “Nice work, Hormozi. Do it again .”\\n \\n***\\n \\nThe “6 week challenge” became the biggest promotion in the gym\\nindustry . For seven years . It drove at least $1.5B in revenue, more\\nby now . I taught it to over 4,500 gyms. And I bet more than\\n10,000+ gyms used versions of the promotion without licensing it.\\nMaybe you saw ads for it in your local market. And yes, if you’re\\ncurious, it got more sophisticated as time went on.\\n \\n \\nHow Paid Ads W ork\\n \\n \\nPaid ads are a way to advertise one-to-many to cold audiences.\\nPeople who don’ t know you. Paid ads work by paying another\\nperson or business to put your of fer in front of their  audience.\\nThink of it like renting eyeballs or earballs. And because you don’ t\\nneed to spend time building an audience, paid ads are the fastest\\nway to get the most people to see your stuf f– Y ou trade money for\\nreach. A considerable advantage when you know what you’r e\\ndoing . Ads are riskier . But, when done right, they can get you more\\nleads than any other method.\\n \\nW ith warm and cold outreach we have to do more stuf f to reach\\nmore people. T o reach more people with free content, we depend\\non the platform or audience sharing it if they feel like it. Paid ads\\nare dif ferent. The reach is guaranteed . But getting your money\\nback isn’ t. So it’ s a game of ef ficiency rather than reach. Let me\\nexplain:\\n \\nIn principle, if you paid enough money , you could get every person\\nin the world to see your ad. And, if every person in the world saw\\nyour ad, someone would buy . Even if only by accident (ha). So the\\nquestion isn’ t “do ads work?” it’ s “ how well  can you make them\\nwork?” In other words, it’ s a push and pull between how much you\\nspend and how much they buy .\\n \\nAnd like cold outreach, paid ads go to colder lower trust audiences.\\nSo even with good of fers, a smaller percentage of people will\\nrespond. And like cold outreach, paid ads get over this hurdle by\\nputting your of fer in front of more people. And if an ad isn’ t\\nprofitable, most of the time, it’ s because the right people never saw\\nit . So to make an ad profitable, the right people have  to  see it. This\\nkeeps our ads ef ficient.\\n \\nThis chapter reveals how I create more ef ficient paid ads by\\nfinding needles in the haystack. I start with the entire world as my\\naudience (haystack) then narrow down to get a higher percentage\\nof engaged leads (needles). First, I pick a platform that contains\\nmy ideal audience. Second, I use whatever tar geting methods that\\nexist within the platform to find them. Third, I craft my ad in a way\\nthat r epels  anyone else. Finally , I tell whoever ’ s left standing to\\ntake the next step. People overcomplicate it. But that’ s it. That’ s all\\nwe’re doing - narrowing down who sees our ad so we have the\\nhighest chance of getting the right type of people to respond.\\n \\nOnce we advertise profitably in a small puddle of an audience, we\\nexpand to a pond, then a lake, then an ocean. And as the audience\\ngets bigger it does have more of the wrong people, but it has more\\nof the right ones too. So ads decrease in ef ficiency , but at that point\\nyou can af ford it. In other words, the ratio between what you spend\\nand how much they buy goes down but the total amount of money\\nyou make goes up. So instead of spending $1000 to make $10,000\\nwith $9000 in profit, you spend $100,000 to make $300,000 with\\n$200,000 in profit. Y our ratio goes down, but you make more\\nmoney . So the risk is higher because you spend more. But so is the\\nreward. This means we want to make the audience as big as\\npossible while still turning a profit.\\n \\nPaid ads give us four new problems to solve. Let’ s break them\\ndown together:\\n \\n1)  Knowing where to advertise\\n \\n2)  Getting the right audience to see it\\n \\n3)  Making the best ad for them to see\\n \\n4)  Getting permission to contact them\\n \\n \\nStep 1: “But wher e do I advertise?” → Find a platform wher e\\nthese four things ar e true\\n \\n \\nPlatforms distribute content to an audience. If you’re not familiar\\nwith any available platforms, I invite you to come join me on\\nplanet earth. If you’ve ever consumed content, which you have,\\nyou’ve directly or indirectly used a platform and been a member of\\nits audience. And wherever there’ s an audience, you can usually\\nadvertise. So if you want to become a great entrepreneur , you have\\nto learn about them. Here’ s what I look for in a platform I want to\\nadvertise on:\\n \\nI\\'ve used it and gotten value from it as a consumer . So I have\\nsome idea how it works.\\n \\nI can tar get people on the platform interested in my stuf f. \\n \\nI know how to format ads specific to the platform (which I’ll\\ndive into in step three).\\n \\nI have the minimum amount of money to spend to place an ad.\\n \\n...And yes, platforms change all the time, but these principles stay\\nthe same .\\n \\n \\nAction Steps: Start with one platform that meets the four\\nrequirements. And start watching, listening, or reading ads on the\\nplatform as a first step to learning how to make one.\\n \\n \\nStep #2: “But how do I get the right people to see it?” →\\nT arget them\\n \\n \\nSo if we start with the entire world, which we kinda do, we need to\\nbe a bit more specific. For example, if you choose a platform that\\nhas 100,000,000 users, you’ve already cut out 99% of the world–\\nright of f the bat. And, if everyone who buys from you speaks\\nEnglish, you also want to exclude  the audiences within the\\nplatform who don\\'t. If that’ s half the platform’ s users, you’re\\nalready at 99.5% of the world excluded. Specific is good.\\n \\nThe right message to the wrong audience will fall on deaf ears. It\\ndoesn’ t matter how good your ads are. If you’re marketing to\\nFlorida residents about a local business in Iowa, it’ s probably not\\ngonna work. So you have only one goal when tar geting–get the\\nhighest number of people you think will buy your stuf f to see your\\nad.\\n \\nW e did our first round of tar geting by selecting our platform. W e\\ndo the second round within  the platform itself. Modern advertising\\nplatforms have two ways to tar get. Y ou can use them separately or\\ncombine them:\\n \\n1)  T ar get a lookalike audience . Modern platforms can show your ad\\nto an audience that is similar to, and much bigger than, a list you\\nprovide. Advertisers call this a lookalike audience.  Modern\\nplatforms will make lookalike audiences for you so long as you\\nupload their minimum list size. The bigger the list and the higher\\nquality the contacts, the more responsive the lookalike audience\\nwill be. Start with your list of current and previous customers. If\\nyour customer list is big enough to meet the platform minimum,\\nuse it. If it’ s not big enough, add your warm reach out list. If it’ s\\nstill not big enough, add your cold reach out leads to hit the\\nminimum. This is exactly what I do. Forcing the list to the right\\nsize sometimes makes the lookalike audience too broad. And\\nthat’ s OK because you can…\\n \\n2)  T ar get with factors of your choosing.  T ar geting options include:\\nage, income, gender , interests, time, location, etc. For example,\\nif you know no one over forty-five or below twenty-five has\\never bought your thing, then exclude anyone outside that range.\\nIf you sell car parts then show your ad during  car shows and on\\ncar channels. If only people with pets buy your thing, then\\ninclude pets as an interest. Basic filters on top of the platform-\\ngenerated lookalike audience are a simple way to get more of\\nthe right people to see your ads. End result: more ef ficient ads.\\n \\n \\nThe more filters you use, the more specific the list. The more\\nspecific the list, the more ef ficient your ads but the faster you will\\n“burn” through it. However , this specificity sets you up to get more\\nwins early on. The wins from smaller specific audiences now give\\nyou the money to advertise to lar ger and broader audiences later .\\nThis is how you scale.\\n \\nAction Steps: Bring all your lead lists together into one place.\\nSeparate them by past and previous customers, warm outreach, and\\ncold outreach. Eventually , you’ll have a list of people that engaged\\nwith your paid ads by giving you contact information but didn’ t\\nbuy . That’ll come in handy . Then, if the platform allows, use these\\nlists in order of quality to create your lookalike audience. Then, if\\nthe platform also allows, add filters on top of your lookalike\\naudience to tar get an even higher percentage of people to engage\\nwith your ad. If you are incapable of making a lookalike audience,\\nthen simply start by tar geting interests.\\n \\n \\nStep #3 “But what should my ad say?” → Call Out + V alue +\\nCall to Action (CT A)\\n \\nT o this day , I don’ t change the channel when I see an ad. I rarely\\nmute ads or skip ads. In fact, I have no premium subscriptions that\\nremove ads on any media platforms either . Main reason: I want to\\nconsume the ads. I want  to see how businesses do three things. 1)\\nHow they call out  their ideal customers. 2) How they present the\\nvalue elements . 3) How they give their audience a call to action .\\nWhen I look at ads this way , it turns what was once an everyday\\nnuisance (ads) into a continuous learning experience. Consuming\\nads on purpose, with the core elements in mind, makes me a better\\nadvertiser . And it will make you a better one too.\\n \\nLet’ s use the three chunks to make an ad.\\n \\n1)  Call Outs - I need to get them to notice my ad \\n \\n2)  V alue - I need to get them interested in what I have to of fer\\n \\n3)  Calls to Action - I need to tell them what to do next\\n \\n \\n1) Call Out: People noticing your ad is the most important part of the\\nad…by a lot .\\nThe purpose of each second of the ad is to sell the next second of the\\nad. And the headline is the first sale . As David Ogilvy says “After\\nyou’ve written your headline, you’ve spent eighty cents of your\\nadvertising dollar .” Focus your ef fort front to back. As crazy as this\\nsounds (and all the pros are nodding their heads), my advertising\\nbecame 20x more ef fective when I focused the majority of my ef fort\\non the first five seconds. W e need the audience’ s eyes and ears just\\nlong enough for them to realize “this is for me, I’ll keep paying\\nattention.” This “first impression” is the part of the ad I test the most .\\n \\nImagine you’re at a cocktail party in a big ballroom. Lots of people\\ntalking in groups. Loud music playing in the background. In all that\\nnoise, a single sound pierces through it all and you turn around.\\nW anna know the sound? Y our name. Y ou hear it, and instantly  look\\nfor the source.\\n \\nScientists call it the ‘cocktail party ef fect’. In simple terms, even when\\nthere’ s tons of stuf f going on, a single thing can still catch and hold\\nour attention. So our goal with callouts is to harness the cocktail party\\nef fect and cut through all  the noise. After all, if they never notice your\\nad, nothing else matters.\\n \\nA callout  is whatever you do to get the attention of your audience.\\nCall outs go from hyperspecific - to get one person’ s attention - to not\\nat all specific - to get everyone’ s attention. Let me explain. If someone\\ndrops a tray of dishes, everyone  looks. If a child yells “MOM!”, then\\nthe moms  look. If someone says your name, only you  look. But again,\\nthey all get attention. And I try to make my call outs specific enough\\nto get the right people and  broad enough to get as many of them as I\\ncan. So pay close attention to how advertisers use call outs, especially\\nthe ones tar geting your audience.\\n \\nHere’ s what I look for with verbal callouts- using wor ds to get\\nattention:\\n \\n1)  Labels : A word or set of words putting people into a gr oup . These\\ninclude features, traits, titles, places, and other descriptors. Ex:\\n*Clark County Moms* *Gym Owners* *Remote W orkers* *I’m\\nlooking for XYZ* etc. T o be most ef fective, your ideal customers\\nneed to identify with the label.\\n \\na)   People automatically identify with their local area. So with\\nlocal ads, the more local, the better . A local ad with “LOCAL\\nAREA + TYPE OF PERSON” callout is still  one of my all-\\ntime favorite ways to get someone’ s attention. It worked two\\nhundred years ago, it works today , and it’ll work tomorrow .\\nSo think: Americans < T exans < Dallas Residents < Irving\\nResidents. If you live in Irving, you’ll immediately think this\\nad could af fect you. So, it catches your attention.\\n \\n2)  Y es-Questions : Questions where if people answer “yes, that’ s me”\\nthey qualify themselves for the of fer .  Ex: *Do you wake up to pee\\nmore than once a night?* *Do you have trouble tying your shoes?*\\n*Do you have a home worth over $400,000?*\\n \\n3)  If-Then Statements : If  they meet your conditions then  you help\\nthem make a decision. *If you run over $100,000 per month in ads,\\nwe can save you 20% or more... *If you were born between 1978\\nand 1986 in Muskogee Oklahoma, you may qualify for a class\\naction lawsuit…*If you want to XYZ, then pay attention…*\\n \\n4)  Ridiculous Results : Bizarre, rare, or out of the ordinary stuf f\\nsomeone would want. *Massage studio books out two years in\\nadvance. Clients furious.* *This woman lost 50 pounds eating\\npizza and fired her trainer* *The government is handing out\\nthousand dollar checks to anyone who can answer three questions*\\nEtc.\\n \\nCallouts don’ t have to be just words. They can also be noises or\\nvisuals in the environment. Let’ s go back to the cocktail party .\\nSure, a dropped tray of dishes would get everyone’ s attention, but\\nso would the cling*cling*cling* of a knife against a champagne\\nflute. They both get everyone’ s attention for dif ferent reasons–one\\nsignals an embarrassing disaster and the other signals important\\nnews… but, in either case, everyone still wants to know what\\nhappens next.  So if the platform allows, good advertisers use\\nverbal and nonverbal callouts together .\\n \\nHere’ s what I look for with nonverbal callouts- using the setting\\nand spokesperson to get attention:\\n \\n1)  Contrast : Any stuf f that “sticks out” in the first few seconds.\\nThe colors. The sounds. The movements etc. Note what\\ncatches your attention. Ex:\\n \\na)   A bright shirt almost always gets more attention than a\\nblack or dull shirt. \\n \\nb)  Attractive people almost always get more attention than\\nplain looking people. \\n \\nc)   Moving stuf f almost always gets more attention than\\nstill stuf f.\\n \\n2)  Likeness : Think visually showing  labels–features, traits, titles,\\nplaces, and other descriptors that people identify with.\\n \\na)   People want to work with people who look, talk, and act\\nin ways familiar to them (and you may not look, talk, or\\nact in ways familiar to them). So if you serve a broad\\ncustomer base use more ethnicities, ages, genders,\\npersonalities etc. in your ads. If you serve a narrow\\ncustomer base (ex: medical devices for seniors), then\\nuse people who look like them.\\n \\ni)             Quack like a duck .  If you want to attract ducks,\\nlook like a duck, walk like a duck, and quack like\\na duck. If you want to attract plumbers, dress like\\na plumber , talk like a plumber , be in a plumbing\\nenvironment. Even with the same message, your\\nad will do far better if you look the part (or find\\npeople who do).\\n \\nii)             If you see an ad for doctors, notice the\\nspokesperson. What age are they? Gender?\\nEthnicity? Are they wearing a lab coat? A\\nstethoscope? Are they in a medical facility? All\\nthese things get a specific type of person\\ninterested in health related products and services\\nto pay more attention than they would have\\notherwise.\\n \\niii)             Mascots also work well because they don’ t age,\\nnever ask for more money , and never take days\\nof f. Think Micky Mouse for Disney . The Geico\\nGecko. T ony the T iger for Kellogg’ s. The\\nMichelin Man. etc. A mascot is a great way to\\ncreate an enduring spokesperson for your\\nbusiness.\\n \\niv)             Advanced:  Whichever likenesses you choose to\\nuse, if it’ s not you, the business becomes less\\ndependent on you and therefore more sellable.\\nY ou also may just be an ugly son of a gun. Plus,\\npretty people convert better anyways. Good news\\nis, it doesn’ t cost much to get a pretty person to\\nsay stuf f to a camera.\\n \\n3)  The Scene:  Think showing  the Y es-Questions and If-Then\\nstatements.\\nEx: An ad with…\\n \\na)   A person tossing and turning in bed calls out people\\nwith sleep troubles.\\n \\nb)  A pear next to an hour glass can call out people with a\\npear shaped body .\\n \\nc)   A room full of stuf f stacked to the ceiling calls out\\npeople with too much junk.\\n \\nd)  A rock hitting a window calls out people with broken\\nwindows.\\n \\ne)   A local landmark. Locals think - “Hey , I know that\\nplace!” and pay attention.\\n \\nNow , this isn’ t an exhaustive list. Far  from it. I show you these to\\npull back the curtain. This way , you can see the infinite ways\\nadvertisers cut through the noise, so you can too.\\n \\n \\nAction Step:  I’m always impressed with the clever and innovative\\nways advertisers call out their prospects. So instead of muting or\\nhitting “skip ad” look for the call outs . Become a student of the\\ngame. My goal is that for the rest of your life when you see an ad\\nyou turn up the volume.\\n \\nNow , once they’ve noticed our ad, it leads us to the second chunk\\nof the ad–we need to get them interested…\\n \\n2) Get Them Inter ested.  If people think an of fer or lead magnet has big\\nbenefits and tiny costs, they value it. And they’ll exchange money or\\ncontact information to get it. But if the cost outweighs the benefits,\\nthey don’ t value it, and they won’ t. So the best ads make the benefits\\nlook as big as possible and the costs look as small as possible . This\\nmakes an of fer or lead magnet as valuable as it can be and gets the\\nmost engaged leads because of it. \\n \\nA good advertisement, paid or not, uses clear and simple ways to\\nanswer the question: why should I be inter ested in your thing?  It tells\\npeople why they should want your lead magnet or of fer . Now , there\\nare a million ways to do this, but I’ll share with you my What-Who-\\nWhen Framework. This mental framework hinges on knowing the\\nvalue equation forwards and backwar ds . So all you have to do is\\nknow eight key things about your own product or service: how it\\nfulfills each element of value for your prospect, and how it helps them\\navoid their hidden costs  (remember those?). Think of them like carrots\\nvs sticks. How your of fer delivers more good stuf f and  less bad stuf f.\\nThen think of the perspectives of the people who would experience\\nthem (Who). And finally , what time period (When) they’d have these\\nexperiences (positive or negative).\\n \\n \\nIn the words of David Ogilvy “The customer isn’ t a moron. She’ s\\nyour wife.” So you know what that means? W rite to her . Ads cause\\nthe prospect to think questions to themselves. And a good ad answers\\nthose questions at precisely the time they think it. So if you can\\nanswer what they’re thinking with your ad, using the words they’d\\nuse, you’ve won.\\n \\nSo let’ s start with The What:  Eight Key Elements\\n \\n●    Dr eam Outcome : A good ad will show and tell the maximum\\nbenefit the prospect can achieve using the thing you sell. It\\nshould align with the ideal prospect’ s dream outcome for that\\nsort of product or service. These are the results they\\nexperience after buying the thing.\\n \\n○    Opposite - Nightmar e : A good ad will also show them\\nthe worst possible hassles, pain, etc. of going without\\nyour solution. In short - the bad stuf f they’ll experience\\nif they don’ t buy .\\n \\n●    Per ceived Likelihood of Achievement : Because of past\\nfailures, we assume that even when we buy , there’ s a risk  we\\ndon’ t get what we want. Lower perceived risk by minimizing\\nor explaining away past failures, emphasizing the success of\\npeople like them, giving assurances by authority , guarantees,\\nand how what you have to of fer will at least give them a\\nbetter chance of success than what they currently do, etc.\\n \\n○    Opposite - Risk : A good ad will also show them how\\nrisky it is to not  act. What will their life be like if they\\ncarried on as they always have? Show how they will\\nrepeat their past failures and how their problems will\\nget bigger and  worse…\\n \\n●    T ime Delay : A good ad will also show them how slow their\\ncurrent trajectory is or that they’ll never  get what they want at\\ntheir current rate…\\n \\n○    Opposite - Speed : T o get things we want - we know we\\nhave to spend time getting them. A good ad will show\\nand tell  how much faster they will get the thing they\\nwant.\\n \\n●    Effort and Sacrifice : A good ad will also show them the\\namount of work and skill they’ll need to get the result without\\nyour solution. And, how they’ll be forced to keep giving up\\nthe things they love and continue suf fering from the things\\nthey hate. Or worse, that they work hard and sacrifice a ton\\nright now… and have gotten… nowher e.  In other words, they\\nwaste more time and money doing what they currently do\\nthan if they just bought our darn solution!\\n \\n○    Opposite - Ease : T o get things we want - we know we\\nhave to change something . But we then assume  we have\\nto do stuf f we hate and give up stuf f we love. And ease\\ncomes from a lack of needed work  or skill . A good ad\\ndisproves the assumption. It tells and shows how you\\ncan avoid the stuf f you hate doing, do more of the stuf f\\nyou love doing, without working hard, or having a lot of\\nskill and still  get the dream outcome .\\n \\nThose are the 8 key elements. Now we fully understand The What\\n– how we deliver the four value elements, and how we avoid their\\nfour opposites. W e now go to the next W - The Who .\\n \\n \\nWho : Humans are primarily status driven. And the status of one\\nhuman comes from how the other humans treat them. So if your\\nproduct or service changes how other people treat your customer ,\\nwhich it does in some way , it pays  to show how . And talking about\\nthe value elements from someone else’ s perspective shows all the\\nways it\\'ll improve the status of your customer . So we want to\\noutline two groups of people. The first group is the people gaining\\nstatus, your customers. The second group is the people giving it to\\nthem: Spouse, Kids, Parents, Extended Family , Colleagues,\\nBosses, Friends, Rivals, Competitors, etc.\\n \\nAll of these perspectives give us dif ferent opportunities to show\\nhow the prospect’ s status may improve. And - they give us a ton  of\\nbonus benefits. As in, if you lose weight, do your kids have a new\\nrole model? Does your spouse now decide to get healthy too? Are\\nyou more likely to get promoted at work? Science says - yes. Does\\nyour frenemy no longer make those little jabs at dinner?\\n \\nLet’ s do business examples. If I said something was risk free, I\\nwant to spell out how their spouse  won’ t nag them about the\\npurchase since there’ s no risk. I’d talk about how their kids would\\nnotice they weren’ t as stressed or distracted anymore about work.\\nHow their competitors notice their phones don’ t ring as much\\nbecause all their customers are flowing to your new customer . How\\ntheir business owner buddies say “business must be good” when\\nthey pull up in their new car at the golf range. Y ou get the idea.\\nThese are all added benefits to the prospect we’d miss out on if we\\nonly  looked at it from their own perspective.\\n \\nAnd, we can apply each new who  perspective to each value driver .\\nThis is how you get so many dif ferent stories, examples, angles,\\netc., to describe the benefits (more carrot and less stick).\\n \\nThat leads me to the third lens of the What-Who-When framework\\n- The When .\\n \\n\\n \\nWhen : People often only think of how their decisions af fect the\\nhere and now . But if we want to be extra compelling (and we do),\\nwe should also explain what their decisions led to in the past and\\nwhat their decisions could  lead to in the future. W e do this by\\ngetting them to visualize through their own timeline (past–present–\\nfuture). This way , we help them to see the consequences of their\\ndecision (or indecision) right now .\\n \\nLet’ s use the weight loss example from earlier fr om their\\nperspective . W e’d show them getting teased as a kid (past)\\nstruggling to button their favorite pair of jeans (present) or moving\\nup yet another  belt loop (future). What does that nightmare look\\nlike to their spouse? T o their rivals? How embarrassing!\\n \\nRemember , we can also run the same timeline through someone\\nelse’ s  perspective. Their kid asking why other kids make fun of\\nthem (because they passed on bad food habits) (past), or how their\\nkids complain now that the other kids’ dads participate at practice\\nwhen they don’ t (present), or how their doctor said they might not\\nwalk their daughter down the aisle at her wedding (future). Note:\\nthis is all the bad stuff  they want to avoid. Our next copy elements\\nwould contrast those with the good stuf f that could happen (present\\nand future) if they buy our thing .\\n \\nW e use both towards good stuf f and away from bad stuf f then\\ncombine it with the past, present, and future of the prospect’ s life\\nto create powerful  motivators in our copy .\\n \\n \\nPutting the What, the Who, and the When together , we answer\\nWHY they should be interested.\\n \\nIf I continued on with the weight loss thing, I might talk about\\nhow:\\n \\nTheir spouse  (WHO) will per ceive how fast  (WHA T) they fit into\\n‘that suit your wife loves that didn’ t fit but does now’ in the futur e\\n(WHEN). Or , how their kids  (WHO) month after month  (WHEN)\\ngot mor e inter ested in eating healthy and tagging along during\\nworkouts  (WHA T). Or , how they  (WHO) catch a look at\\nthemselves in a r eflection in the mall in a few months (WHEN) and\\nr ealize ‘stuff actually fits me in this stor e’  (WHA T).\\n \\n \\nWhen we combine:\\n \\neverything we can to get the prospect going towar d  the four\\nvalue drivers, while also getting them away fr om  their opposites\\n \\nthe many perspectives we can show them gaining status, and  \\n \\ndif ferent timelines for each…\\n \\n…This adds up to why  they should be interested. And now we have\\na lot of ways to get them interested! And - the more angles we\\ncover , the more interested they’ll become.\\n \\nAlso - since you asked - the only dif ference between long ads and\\nshort ads is how many angles we have time to cover from the\\ncopywriting framework. Longer ads use more. Shorter ads use\\nfewer . So add or take away based on the platform, but keep the\\ncallouts (the first few seconds) and CT As (what to do next) the\\nsame.\\n \\n \\nAction Steps: Get as many advertising angles with your of fer as\\nyou can with the What-Who-When framework.\\n \\nWhat:  Know the eight key things about your own product or\\nservice. How it fulfills each element of value, and how it helps\\navoid their opposites .\\n \\nWho:  Show how the eight key things about your product or service\\ncan change your pr ospect’ s  status. Then, show how the people they\\nknow  give status to the prospect when they buy your thing or take\\nstatus away if they don’ t.\\n \\nWhen : Get the prospect to see the consequences of buying and not\\nbuying through their past, present, and future. Especially through\\ntheir change in status with people they know . This way , we help\\nthem to see the value of their decision (or indecision) at this very\\nmoment.\\n \\n \\nI also include a few more ad tips and tricks that have served me\\nwell in the lessons at the end of the chapter . But even if you never\\nuse them, there’ s only one more thing you’ll need to turn these\\ninterested folks into engaged leads…\\n \\n3) CT A - T ell Them What T o Do Next\\n \\nIf your ad got them interested, then your audience will have huge\\nmotivation… for a tiny time. T ake advantage. T ell them exactly\\nwhat to do next . S-P-E-L-L it out: Click this button. Call this\\nnumber . Reply with “YES.” Go to this website. Scan this QR Code\\n(wink). So many ads still  don’ t do this. Y our audience can only\\nknow what to do if you tell them.\\n \\nMake CT As quick and easy . Easy phone numbers, obvious buttons,\\nsimple websites. For example, a common CT A is to direct the\\naudience to a website. So make your web address short and\\nmemorable:\\n \\nInstead of…  alexsprivateequityfirm.com/free-book-and-course2782\\n \\nUse.. acquisition.com/training\\n \\nNote: This comes from a guy who spent $370,000 on a single word\\ndomain Acquisition.com . So, I may overvalue easy domains, but I\\ndon’ t think I do. I think everyone else under values them. Just my\\ntwo cents.\\n \\n\\n \\nBeyond these basics which most still for get, you can also use all\\nthe tactics like ur gency , scarcity , and bonuses from “Step 7” from\\nthe “engage your leads” chapter to make even stronger CT As. They\\napply here, and everywhere else you tell your audience to do\\nsomething.\\n \\nSo we can now pick a platform to advertise on, tar get who we\\nshow our ads to, make the ads they see, and tell them what to do\\nnext. All we have to do now is get their contact information.\\n \\n \\nStep #4 “How do I get their info?” → Get Permission T o\\nContact Them\\nAfter they take the action–Get. Their . Contact. Information .  My\\nfavorite way to get contact information is a simple landing page.\\nDon’ t overthink it. The simpler your landing page, the easier it is\\nto test. Focus on the words and the image. Here are my three\\nfavorite templates. Pick one and start testing.\\n \\n \\nAnd make your landing pages match your ads.  People click an ad\\nbecause you promised them some benefit. So carry that same look\\nand language over to your landing page. Make sure what you\\npromised in your ad is what you deliver . This sounds simple, but a\\nlot of people for get, and waste money until they remember it. Y ou\\ndon’ t want to end up with some Frankenstein experience where\\neverything looks dif ferent. Y ou want a continuous experience from\\n“click to close.”\\n \\nGet more people through more steps . In Robert Cialdini’ s seminal\\nwork, Influence , he shows that people like to think of themselves\\nas consistent. So, if you remind them of the action they just took\\n(CT A), and show how taking the next action aligns with it, you’ll\\nget more people to take the second action (Contact Info). For\\nexample, “Now that you just did A, you need to do B to get the\\nmost of A.” Or  “Doing A makes you a ‘doing A ’ kind of person.\\nDoing A kind of people, do B.”\\n \\nT o be clear , we aren’ t selling anything. W e are asking if they’re\\ninterested in the stuf f we sell. And if they’re interested, they’ll give\\nus a way to tell them more about it. And when they do, they\\nbecome engaged leads. W oo!\\n \\nAction Step: Build your first landing page. I wasted four years\\nfeeling too scared to make a landing page. When I finally tried, I\\nfinished before lunch. Nowadays there are tons of “drag and drop”\\ntools to build websites in minutes. And if you’re still worried about\\nit, freelancers will build a site, probably using those same drag and\\ndrop tools, on the cheap. So just get it done.\\n \\n→ Now , you have engaged leads fr om paid ads!  Hooray! W e did\\nit!\\n \\n \\nRun Paid Ads Part I Conclusion\\n \\nWhat has to  happen for advertising to work? W ell, we have to\\nshow our ad to the right people. So, we pick the right platform and\\ntar get the people within that platform that have the highest\\npercentage of our audience. Once we do that, we have to get them\\nto notice  our ad. Once they notice it, they have to consume it to get\\na reason  to take action now rather than later . W e do that using the\\nvalue equation. And demonstrate it in the past, present and future,\\nfrom their perspective and the perspectives of the people they\\nknow . And once they have a reason to take action, they have to\\nhave a way to give us permission to contact them.  That action\\nturns them into an engaged lead . And since those things gotta\\nhappen, they slowly but surely became the three core elements of\\nevery ad I create:\\n \\n1)  Callouts (for them to notice it)\\n \\n2)  V alue Elements (to give them reason to do something)\\n \\n3)  Calls to action (to give them a way to do it)\\n \\n \\nNow… only one question remains…how ef ficient are we? Let’ s\\ntalk about money stuf f.\\n# 4  R u n  P a i d  A d s  P a r t  I I :  M o n e y  S t u f f\\n“I’m just trying to buy a dolla’ and sell it for two” - Pr oposition\\nJoe, The W ir e\\n \\nW e focus on ef ficiency with paid ads throughout this chapter and\\nthe last one because efficiency matters mor e than cr eativity . All\\nadvertising works. The only thing that dif fers between\\nadvertisements is how well  they work. Maybe people get crazy\\nabout making paid ads because they have words like “copy” and\\n“creative” and “media” then get hyper -focused on getting all that\\nstuf f “perfect” (as if you can). Y ou can tweak all day and night…\\nuntil the cows come home! The reality is that paid ads, any\\nadvertising really , is all about  the r eturn on your investment. And\\nwith paid ads it gets clear as day because you put X dollars in for\\npeople to see the ad and get Y dollars out if they buy your stuf f. So\\nif you want a $100M leads  machine, you just need to get it \"good\\nenough\" to scale. Why? Because good enough is good enough.\\n \\nSince ef ficiency matters most, we want to be as ef ficient as\\npossible so we can scale as much as possible. That way , we get as\\nmany leads as our little heart’ s desire.\\n \\nThat being said, there’ s enough nuance to scaling paid ads that it\\nfelt better to break it into its own chapter . This chapter answers\\nfour big questions about ads as I understand them:\\n \\nHow much do I spend? →Three Phases of Scaling Ads\\n \\nHow do I know how well I’m doing? →Cost & Benchmarks\\n \\nIf my ads aren’ t profitable, how do I fix it? →Client Financed\\nAcquisition.\\n \\nWhat do I wish I had known before I ran my first paid ad?\\n→Lessons\\n \\n“But how much do I spend on paid ads?”→ The Thr ee Phases\\nof Scaling Paid Ads\\n \\nThere are three stages to spending money on ads as I see it.\\n \\nPhase One:  T rack Money\\n \\nPhase T wo:  Lose Money\\n \\nPhase Three:  Print Money\\n \\nLet’ s break them down together .\\n \\n \\nPhase One :  T rack Money .  Before spending a dollar on ads, set\\neverything up so you can accurately track your returns. If you\\ndon’ t track, you’re gonna get cleaned out. It would be like going to\\na casino and playing your favorite game for as long as you felt like\\nit rather than for as long as you could af ford it. But, once you have\\ntracking, you can do more of the stuf f that makes you money and\\nless of the stuf f that doesn\\'t. It rigs the game in your favor . So get a\\nconsultant, watch tutorials, and get it set up. End of story . Once\\nyou have the tracking, you can start losing money like a pro\\n(wink).\\n \\nPhase T wo : Lose money  (half-joking). I prefer to call it ‘investing\\nin a money printing machine.’ After all, when running paid ads,\\nyou pay first. So your bank account has to go down before it comes\\nup.\\n \\nI emphasize this because I\\'d rather prepare you: you’r e gonna lose\\nmoney . In fact, I\\'ve lost money more times  than I’ve made money\\nrunning paid ads. But every time I make money with paid ads, I\\nmake back everything I lost, and then a bunch mor e. So the\\nnumber of times I lose is high but the amount I lose is low because\\nI know when to shut it down. And my number of wins is low but\\nthe amount I win is very high because I know when to hit the gas.\\nSo, think of it like this.\\n \\nImagine I spend $100 on ten ads - $1,000 in total. Nine of them\\nlose all $100. Then, one of them makes $500 back for the $100 I\\nspent. I’m still down $500. Many people stop here because they\\nsee a $500 dollar loss. But not us. W e see a winner . So now we\\nbuckle up and 100x down. W e spend $10,000 on the winning ad\\nand make $50,000 back.\\n \\nNote: I still lost nine times , but the one time  I won, I won big. And\\nthis is important, because you might lose, nine or ninety-nine times\\nin a row before you win big. But, to win big, you have to see the\\nwinners and double, triple, quadruple, 10x down on them . This is\\nwhy paid advertising is a lot like a casino. Y ou’ll often lose in the\\nbeginning to learn the game. But - with enough skill - you\\neventually become the house. That being said, during this “lose\\nmoney” phase, you can still be smart about it. Here’ s how I do it.\\n \\nI budget two times the cash I collect fr om a customer in thirty\\ndays ( not  L TGP) when testing new ads.  I wasted tons of money\\nletting ads run too long before I realized they sucked. But on the\\nflipside, I’ve lost even more money by giving up on ads before I\\ngave them a chance. Eventually , I hit a sweet spot by budgeting\\ntwo times  the cash I collected from a new customer in the first\\nthirty days to test a new ad. For example, if I know I make $100 in\\nprofit from a customer in the first thirty days, I’ll let an ad go up to\\n$200 in spend before shutting it of f (as long as I’m getting leads).\\nIf I’m not getting any leads from an ad at all, before I spend 1x\\nthirty-day cash I shut it of f ($100 in the example).\\n \\nIt costs money to build an advertising machine . I worked with a\\nbusiness that took a year to get paid ads profitable. It was tough.\\nBut other businesses in their space ran profitable ads which meant\\nwe could too . Once they were profitable, they made their year ’ s\\nworth of ‘wasted’ money back in the next  month . It costs money to\\nbuild an advertising machine…and that’ s normal . Just make sure\\nyou measure the returns over a long time horizon, not next week.\\nCan you think of anything more valuable than a machine that\\nprints money? It would be unreasonable for it be cheap (or easy).\\nOnce you start making more money than it costs you to make it,\\nyou’re in phase three.\\n \\nPhase Thr ee : Print Money .  If you’re making back more money\\nthan you spend - the answer is simple - spend as much as you can .\\nAfter all, if you had a magic machine that gave you $10 for every\\n$1 you put into it, what would your budget be? Right. All the\\nmoney . But realistically , you probably have some other constraint\\non your business that prevents you from unlimited customers\\ncoming in. So here’ s how I scale my budget.\\n \\nInstead of asking “How much money should I spend on an ad?” I\\nask “How many customers do I want?” or “How many customers\\ncan I handle?” So once ads break even or better , I reverse my\\nbudget from my sales goals . If I can only handle 100 customers\\nnext month, and customers cost me $100 to get, I‘d need to spend\\n$10,000 to get them (100 x $100). But since ads get less ef ficient\\nas they scale, I usually pad the budget by twenty percent. So that\\nmeans $12,000 over thirty days, or $400 per day in ad spend. I\\nreverse my daily ad budget from my lead-getting goal. Then, I\\ncommit to it .  If the number terrifies you, then you’re doing it right.\\nT rust the data. This is how you scale. And that’ s why most people\\nnever do.\\n \\n \\n“How well am I doing?” - Cost & Returns - Efficiency\\nBenchmarks\\n \\nEf ficient paid ads make more money than they cost. If that sounds\\npainfully obvious, good. Y ou’ve already got most people beat. I\\nmeasure paid ad ef ficiency by comparing the lifetime gross profit\\nof a customer (L TGP) with the cost to acquire a customer (CAC). I\\nexpress this ratio as L TGP to CAC.\\n \\nI Measure L TGP Instead of “Lifetime V alue” or “L TV”\\n \\nLifetime gr oss pr ofit  is all the money a customer ever spends on\\nyour stuf f minus all the money it takes to deliver it. For example, if\\na customer buys something for $15 and it costs $5 to deliver it,\\nyour gross profit is $10. So if that customer buys ten things over\\ntheir lifetime, then they bought a total of $150 in stuf f. But it cost\\nyou a total of $50 to deliver that stuf f.  That makes the lifetime\\ngross profit $100.\\n \\nGr oss pr ofit  is important in general because it\\'s the actual money\\nyou use to acquire customers, pay rent, cover payroll, and...\\neverything else to run your business.\\n \\n \\nSo if you’ve ever heard me say “I’m getting 3 to 1 on this” I refer\\nto my L TGP-to-CAC ratio. I compare how much I made against\\nhow much I spent. So if L TGP is greater than CAC, you have\\nprofitable advertising. If it’ s lower than CAC, you’re losing money .\\n \\nWhat\\'s a good L TGP to CAC ratio? Every business I invest in that\\nstruggles to scale has at least one thing in common - their L TGP to\\nCAC ratio was less than  3 to 1. As soon as I get it above 3 to 1\\n(either through decreasing CAC or increasing L TGP), they take\\nof f. This is a pattern I personally observed, not a rule.\\n \\n \\nY ou have two big levers to improving L TGP:CAC:\\n \\nMake CAC lower - Get cheaper customers. W e do this with\\nmore ef ficient ads following the steps we just outlined.\\n \\nMake L TGP higher - Increase how much you make per\\ncustomer . W e do this with a better business model.\\n \\nFor maximum money… I pr efer to do both .\\n \\nFor example, if you made a billion dollars per customer , then you\\ncould spend nine hundred and ninety-nine million dollars to get a\\ncustomer and still  have a million dollars leftover . Y ou could spend\\npretty much whatever it takes to get a customer . No matter how\\ncrappy your ads - you’d still probably win. On the flip side, if you\\nmade one cent per customer , you’d have to get each customer for\\nless than a penny  to make it work. Even with the best ads, you’d\\nfail.\\n \\nI bring this up because we speak with hundreds of entrepreneurs\\nevery month. They often think they have crappy ads (high CAC)\\nwhen, in reality , they have a crappy business model (Low L TGP).\\nHere’ s a finding that will probably surprise you as much as it\\nsurprised me. The cost to acquire customers, between competitors\\nin the same industry , is much closer than you’d think . The\\ndif ference between the winners and the losers is how much they\\nmake off each customer .\\n \\nSo how do you know if it’ s your ads or your business model that\\nneeds work? I use the industry average CAC as my guide. \\nResearch your industry averages for the cost to acquire customers.\\nIf your CAC is below 3x your industry average (good), focus on\\nyour business model (L TGP). If your CAC is above 3x the average\\n(bad), focus on  your advertising (CAC).\\n \\nThings can only get so cheap. Eventually you just gotta make\\nmore. Think about it like this– lowering the cost of getting a\\ncustomer by $100 will eventually take more work than making an\\nextra $100 from them. So once your cost is low enough, focus on\\nyour business model. Costs can only approach zero but how much\\nyou make can go up to infinity . Increasing advertising ef ficiency\\nbeyond a certain point is like trying to “save your way” to a billion\\ndollars. Y ou feel like you’re making progress, but you’re never\\ngonna get there.\\n \\n \\n“My ads ar en’t pr ofitable, how do I fix it?” → Client Financed\\nAcquisition\\n \\nFor many businesses, L TGP is bigger than CAC. Y ay . But not after\\nthe first pur chase.  Boo. The profit from the customer ’ s first\\npur chase  is often less than the cost to get them. It can take many\\nmonths to collect the full L TGP . So you get your money later\\ninstead of now . This cash flow problem cripples your ability to\\nscale ads and get more customers. Boo again.\\n \\nBut… if your customer spends more than it costs you to get and\\nfulfill them–in the first 30 days–then you have the funds to scale\\nnow  and for ever . I call this  client financed acquisition.\\n \\nI pick thirty days because any business can get interest free money\\nfor thirty days in the form of a credit card. And if we make more\\nthan the cost to get and fulfill the customer in the first thirty days,\\nwe square our balance. Now , we have zero debt and a new\\ncustomer which we can keep profiting from forever . Then, we\\nrepeat the process. Money is no longer your bottleneck. This is the\\nkey to limitless scale. I r epeat the same image above so you can\\nr efer ence it.\\n \\n \\nLet’ s see client financed acquisition in action:\\n \\nSay we have a $15 per month membership that costs us $5 to\\ndeliver . That leaves us $10 gross profit left over .\\n \\n($15 membership) - ($5 cost) = $10 gross profit per month\\n \\nAnd let’ s say our average member stays for ten months. That\\nmakes our lifetime gross profit $100.\\n \\n($10 gross profit per month) x (10 months) = $100 L TGP .\\n \\nIf the cost to get a customer is $30 (CAC = $30), we have a\\n3.3:1 L TGP : CAC ratio.\\n \\n($100 L TGP) / ($30 CAC)  = 3.3 L TGP / 1 CAC →  3.3:1\\nOur ads make money . Hooray .\\n \\n \\nBut wait…there’ s a problem. Y ou spent $30 in ads and only got\\n$10 back. T en bucks trickles in, one month at a time, until you\\nfinally break even…two. months. later . That’ s tough! Make no\\nmistake, you should 100% make that trade. But, now we have a\\ncash flow  problem.\\n \\n \\nHere’ s the way I fix it- I immediately sell them mor e stuff\\n \\nIf I of fer a $100 upsell (with 100% mar gins) that one in five new\\ncustomers take. That adds $20 of gross profit per customer .\\n \\n($100 upsell) /(5 customers) = $20 average upsell dollars per\\ncustomer .\\n \\nThis takes us from $10 to $30 in the first thirty days (our break-\\neven window). The first purchase is $10. But now  the average\\nupsell adds $20.\\n \\n$10 + $20 = $30 gross profit per customer in less than 30\\ndays.\\n \\nAnd since it costs $30 to acquire them, we break even. Great!\\n \\n$30 CAC - $30 cash collected within thirty days = free\\ncustomers!\\n \\nEvery $10 a month that comes in thereafter is “gravy .” Now , I can\\ngo get another customer while I keep collecting that $10 profit per\\nmonth for the next nine months. This is how you print money . The\\nthings you can sell or upsell are unlimited.\\n \\nIf I cover the cost to get and fulfill a customer in the first thirty\\ndays I can pay of f my card, then do it again. It’ s how I’ve scaled\\nevery company I’ve started for the past seven years past $1M/mo\\nin the first twelve months - without outside funding. W ith\\nef ficiency out of the way , creativity is your only limit.\\n \\nBottom Line : Figure out a way to get your customers to pay you\\nback in the first thirty days so you can recycle your cash to get\\nmore customers.\\n \\n \\nPersonal Lessons fr om Paid Ads\\n \\n1 . Don’t Confuse Sales Pr oblems W ith Advertising Pr oblems.\\nThe cost to get customers doesn’ t only come from advertising (it\\njust mostly does)… For example, a company I invested in spent\\ntwelve weeks and $150,000 to run paid ads. They were getting\\nthe right leads on the phone, but they weren’ t buying. The owner\\nsaid advertising didn’ t work. But the ads worked fine, great\\neven, their sales sucked . The owner threw up his hands and gave\\nup…six inches from gold. Frustrating. Confusing an advertising\\nproblem with a sales problem cost them an estimated ~$30M in\\nenterprise value. If your engaged leads have the problem you\\nsolve and the money to spend, and they’re not buying, then your\\nads work fine–you have a sales problem.\\n \\n2 . Y our Best Fr ee Content Can Make The Best Paid Ads.  Some\\nof the best paid ads I’ve ever run came from free content. If you\\nmake a free content piece that generates sales, or performs very\\nwell, nine times out of ten it’ll make a great paid ad.\\n \\na . User Generated Content (UGC).  If you can get your\\ncustomers to create testimonials or reviews using your\\nproduct, post them. If they perform well as free content,\\nthey often make killer ads too. Having a system in place\\nto encourage these public posts from customers is my\\nfavorite way of getting a steady stream of potential ads.\\nAnd - the best part is - it’ s no extra work.\\n \\n3 . If Y ou Say Y ou Suck At Something, Y ou W ill Pr obably Suck\\nAt It.  Never say “I’m not techy” or “I hate tech stuf f.” It just\\nkeeps you poorer than you should be. I said it for…wait for it…\\nFOUR YEARS. Then one day , I snapped because I hated my\\nwebsite designer more than I hated tech itself. “If this idiot can\\ndo it, so can I.” Four years of wasting time and lost money\\nreversed with four hours of concentrated ef fort.\\n \\n \\nY our turn\\n \\nI can teach you how to place an ad in twenty minutes. It’ll cost ya\\n$100. W orth it?  I hope so. It’ s an important skill. It won’ t make\\nyou money , but you will learn a lesson worth far more than a\\nhundred bucks - running ads is easier than you think. In fact,\\nplatforms spend zillions to make it as easy as possible (so they can\\nmake more money).  Here’ s all you gotta do:\\n \\nSearch “HOW T O PLACE A [PLA TFORM] AD.” Then place one\\nfor $100. Don’ t go all the way to the end then chicken out. Spend\\nthe gosh darn money . Rip of f the bandaid. As soon as you do -\\nyou’re no longer an observer , you\\'re in the game.\\n \\nOnce you have put all these pieces together , it’ s time to send it.\\nSpend money . Start with an acceptable amount of money you are\\nwilling to lose each month. Expect to lose it. Y ou won’ t be earning,\\nyou’ll be learning.\\n \\nIf you recall our advertising checklist, you’ll need to pick each line\\nto fill out your action card. This kicks of f your journey in paid ads\\nto get more engaged leads. Sample Paid Ads Checklist:\\n \\n \\n \\nPaid Ads Part II Conclusion\\n \\nPaid ads are the fastest way to scale how many leads you get. W e\\nspent the lion’ s share of this chapter talking about ef ficiency .\\nBecause once you understand how ads really make money , it\\nbecomes much easier to win. I’ve been very successful with paid\\nads, but it wasn’ t because I was the most creative or had the best\\ncopy . It was because I knew the numbers. So follow the steps\\noutlined.\\n \\nI recommend doing paid ads last  for two reasons. First, skills from\\nthe other three methods transfer to this one. And second, paid ads\\ncost money . Money you will have if you start with the other three\\nmethods first. So learn the skills and make the money from the\\nother three methods, so you have the shortest learning curve on this\\none.\\n \\nAnd once we have all that, we scale it. W e expect to lose more\\ntimes than we win. And once we win, we scale the hell out of it.\\nAnd that’ s how we do it.\\nPaid ads is the last of the core four ways a single person can let\\nother people know about their stuf f. But before we transition to the\\nsecond half of the book, I wanna show you how to put these\\nstrategies on steroids.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nC o r e  F o u r  O n  S t e r o i d s :  M o r e  B e t t e r  N e w\\n“If at first you don’ t succeed, use for ce.”\\n \\n \\nI surveyed the fifty or so faces of the group. All entrepreneurs\\nlooking to scale their businesses. Each hungry for the “missing\\nlink”  that would flood them with engaged leads. After finishing a\\npresentation on lead generation, I opened up the floor for Q&A :\\n \\nThe first business owner chimed in, “I just feel like I’ve saturated\\nthe market. I don\\'t think we can get any bigger in the chiropractor\\nniche than we already are.”\\n \\n“What’re you doing in revenue?” I asked.\\n \\n“$2,000,000 a year”\\n \\n“And how much do you spend on advertising?”\\n \\n“About $30,000 a month on Facebook”\\n \\n“What’ s your conversion rate from click to close?”\\n \\n“I don’ t know”\\n \\n“So you don’ t track overall throughput?”\\n \\n“I guess not.”\\n \\n“Okay…What other platforms do you advertise on?”\\n \\n“None.”\\n \\n“How much content do you make for chiropractors?”\\n \\n“None.”\\n \\n“How much cold outreach do you do?”\\n \\n“None.”\\n \\n“And the $30k you spend, on one platform, for a two million dollar\\nbusiness, saturated the $15.1B chiropractor industry? Does that\\nsound reasonable?”\\n \\nA second business owner chimed in before he could answer \"If it\\nhelps - I\\'m in the chiropractor niche too, and I spent $30k in\\nadvertising, across four  platforms, last week... \"\\n \\n“Do you still feel like you’ve saturated your niche?” I asked.\\n \\n He got the point.\\n \\n***\\n \\nI have this conversation daily with entrepreneurs looking to grow .\\nT ypically , they have figured out how to get enough customers from\\none  platform to get them to $1M-$3M per year . It’ s still not\\ncompletely predictable. And they have their ups and downs. But\\nthey have the “gist” of what they need to do and have seen some\\nsuccess. So it’ s at this point they hit a wall because they think they\\ncan\\'t make more money . They assume they’ve “tapped” their\\nmarket. I kid you not. I had a conversation with a dif ferent\\nentrepreneur making about $3,000,000 per year in the weight loss\\nspace. He worried increasing his ad spend past $40,000 per month\\nwould saturate his ad platform. For context, that platform has over\\n1B active daily users. And he was selling weight loss… in\\nAmerica…  a $60B industry . Silly .\\n \\nThere are more leads out there than you can possibly imagine. I’ve\\nused a framework to unlock those leads over and over again and\\nnow you can use it too.\\n \\n \\nHow T o Get Even Mor e Leads: Mor e Better New\\n \\nFirst, you reach out to people who know you. Then, you start\\nmaking free content. Then you start reaching out to people who\\ndon’ t know you. Then you start running paid ads. This is how you\\ndo  the core four to get engaged leads. And there’ s really nothing\\nelse a single person can do on their own  to get them.\\n \\nBut what if you are doing the core four and still not getting as\\nmany engaged leads as you want? W ell, worry not! There are two\\nways to boost any  of the core four to get even more engaged leads\\non your own . I use these every time I want to increase the engaged\\nlead flow in a portfolio company . They are easy to remember:\\nMor e, Better , New .\\n \\nSimply stated:\\n \\n1)  Y ou can do mor e  of what you’re currently doing. \\n \\n2)  Y ou can do what you’re currently doing better .\\n \\n3)  Y ou can do it somewhere new .\\n \\nAnd, just like the story in the beginning with the agency owner ,\\nthat\\'s  exactly what I was asking him . Could you advertise more?\\nCould you advertise better? Could you advertise somewhere new?\\n \\nSo let’ s start with the one I actually do first: Mor e .\\n \\nMor e\\n \\n \\nY ou’ve done some advertising by now . And you know the\\nadvertising that you do works to some degree. So the next obvious\\nthing you can do to get more engaged leads is - mor e . A lot mor e.\\nCrank up the volume to your max capacity .\\n \\nEven with no improvements at all, if you double your inputs,\\nyou’ll get more engaged leads. Make twice the reach outs, post\\ntwice the content, run twice the ads, double the ad spend, etc. Y ou\\nwon’ t regret it. Unless, of course, you hate money .\\n \\nSo while we’ll always focus on testing to make ourselves better ,\\nwhich we’ll get to in a moment,  the biggest  increases often come\\nfrom advertising mor e .\\n \\n \\nHere’ s how I do mor e : The Rule of 100\\n \\nThe rule of 100 is simple. Y ou advertise your stuf f by doing 100\\nprimary actions every day , for one hundred days in a row . That’ s it.\\nI don\\'t make many promises, but this is one. If you do 100 primary\\nactions per day , and you do it for 100 days straight, you will get\\nmore engaged leads. Commit to the rule of 100 and you will never\\ngo hungry again.\\n \\nHere’ s what it looks like applied to each of the core four:\\n \\nW arm Reach Outs:\\n100 reach outs per day\\n \\nExample primary actions: email, text, direct message, calls, etc.\\n \\nPost Content:\\n \\n100 minutes per day making content.\\n \\nRelease at least one per day on a platform. As you get better , post\\neven more.\\n \\nExample primary actions: short and long videos or articles,\\npodcasts, infographics, etc.\\n \\nCold Reach Outs:\\n \\n100 reach outs per day\\n \\nExample primary actions: email, text, direct message, cold call,\\nflyers, etc.\\n \\nAs with all cold advertising, expect lower r esponse rates, so use\\nautomation.\\n \\nPaid Ads:\\n \\n100 minutes per day making paid ads\\n \\nExample primary actions: direct response media ads, direct mail,\\nseminar , podcast spots, etc.\\n \\n100 days straight of running those paid ads. Use the daily budget\\nwe calculated together in the paid ads chapter . Aim for Client\\nFinanced Acquisition.\\n \\n \\nHer e’ s some inspiration fr om someone in #Mozination following\\nthe rule of 100:\\n \\n \\n \\nBetter\\n \\n \\nGetting better gets you more leads for the same ef fort. W e want\\nthat. And you can only get better by doing one thing–testing. So\\nyou do more and more… until it br eaks . Then, you make it better .\\nIn other words, if you do mor e for long enough, your CAC will\\neventually get too high to sustain. So you make a tweak and see if\\nit improves. If it does, keep doing it. If it doesn’ t, toss it out.\\nThousands of these tiny tests separate the winners from the\\nbeginners.\\n \\nEvery action a lead takes before they become a customer is a\\npotential “drop-of f” point. So I do the most testing at whatever step\\nthe most leads dr op off.  I call these “constraints.” Constraints are\\nthe points where the smallest improvements create the biggest\\nboost in results. That\\'s why they\\'re so important. W e get the\\nbiggest bang for our buck. For example, if you have three steps in\\nyour process:\\n \\n30% Optin (give you their contact information)\\n \\n5% Apply ← This is the constraint because it has the biggest drop-\\nof f\\n \\n50% Schedule\\n \\nBut let’ s ignore the constraint for a moment. Imagine we improve\\neach step by 5% by itself.\\n \\n30 + 5%→35% Optin = 16% Increase in leads (1.16x)\\n \\n5 + 5%→10% Apply = 100% Increase in leads (2x)\\n \\n50 + 5%→55% Schedule = 10% Increase in leads (1.1x)\\n \\n \\nW e get wildly dif ferent results! Improving the constraint also\\ncomes out the clear winner . So, focus on the constraint.  And,\\nagain, if you’re not sure which step is the biggest constraint, find\\nthe step where the most leads drop of f. Y ou’ll get the biggest\\nreward for the smallest improvement.\\n \\nHere’ s how I get better : I test one thing per week per platform . And\\nI do it for four big reasons.\\n \\n1)  If you test multiple things at a time on one platform you never\\nreally learn what worked.\\n \\n2)  Steps af fect each other . A single change can af fect results at\\nother steps. For example, if you change step one, and more\\npeople optin, but fewer  people apply , no bueno. But you\\nwouldn’ t know that if you changed both steps. If you make one\\nchange you can see what happened . If you make a bunch of\\nchanges…good luck trying to figure out what worked (or\\ndidn’ t).\\n \\n3)  It forces you to prioritize what will get you the most engaged\\nleads. Y ou can do an infinite amount of tests. But, time is\\nlimited. So you must choose your tests wisely . For example, if\\nyou only do one “big” test per week per platform, don’ t waste it\\non a color change from red to bright red.\\n \\n4)  Maybe the most important, you run the test for long enough to\\nsee if you actually get an improvement. T oo short and you won’ t\\nget enough data. T oo long and you waste time you could’ve\\nspent improving the next constraint. W ith the size of my team\\nand the amount of money I spend on advertising, one week is\\ntypically long enough for me.\\n \\nIn every company I own, I set up a testing schedule. Every\\nMonday we run one split test per platform. W e give it a week. And\\nthe next Monday , we do three things:\\n \\n1)  Look at the results, and pick the winners for each platform test.\\n \\n2)  Then (important), we write down the results of the test in a log\\nof all tests. So the next time we do something, we start a zillion\\nimprovements later , not at square one.\\n \\n3)  Come up with our next test to beat our current ‘best’ version. If\\nwe can’ t beat the version we’re currently running in four tries\\n(or one month) , we move onto the next constraint.\\n \\nY ou continue to allocate ef fort to make things better . But, at a\\ncertain point, the ef fort you put into making it better brings lower\\nand lower returns. At some point, it makes more sense to invest\\nyour ef fort into something that will bring higher returns. Only at\\nthis point, do we try something new .\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNew\\n \\nSo after you’ve improved your marketing ef forts through ‘more’\\nand ‘better ’ the only thing you have left is - ‘new places in new\\nways.’ In simple terms– new . And if you think your business can’ t\\npossibly get any bigger , let me show you why  it can. Then, I’ll\\nshow you how  it can.\\n \\n \\nMost business owners look only at the platform and tiny\\ncommunity they market in. And usually , there are only three or\\nfour big companies marketing in their niche. So, they assume those\\ncompanies must  split the entir e  market between them. This is\\nexactly what the entrepreneur in my intro story did. Think for a\\nmoment about how ridiculous this is. I call this problem: The Size\\nOf The Pie Fallacy . Here’ s a drawing to illustrate how the market\\nis, in fact, much bigger than most assume.\\n \\n \\nThe  Size Of The Pie Fallacy . A small  business uses one of the\\ncore four , on one platform, in one specific way , with a very\\ntar geted audience. And in that same  space, advertising the same\\nway , there may only be a handful of other competitors.\\n \\nThey mistakenly assume the tiny  slice of the universe they\\nadvertise to is the entire available market! This is why most\\nbusinesses stay small. When they plateau, they think there’ s no\\nmore leads to get. They believe they got as big as they possibly\\ncan. Because, for many , saying \"I\\'m as big as I can get\" is much\\neasier than saying \"I’m not as good at advertising as I thought.”\\nThis false ar gument keeps entrepreneurs everywhere poorer than\\nthey should be.\\n \\nWhen to do new : When the returns you get from doing\\nmore↔better are lower than what you could get from a new\\nplacement or new way of advertising.\\n \\nThere are many other slices of attention (and potential leads)\\nsitting just inside the tiny universe of “post content .” They could\\nadd new placements  (since many platforms have multiple places\\nand forms of content). For example, on Instagram you can make\\nstories, messenger ads, and posts. On Y ouT ube you can make\\nshorts, longs, community posts, etc. Or , they could add a new\\nplatform . They go from Instagram messenger to Facebook\\nmessenger . They go from Y ouT ube shorts videos to Instagram\\nshort videos (reels). Etc. And once they’ve exhausted those, they\\ncould add an entirely new core four  activity .\\n \\nAnd if you\\'re curious, the order I pick my next ‘new’ comes down\\nto one thing: what will get me the most leads for the amount of\\nwork? That is the rule. And nine times out of ten, it goes like this:\\n \\nNew placements→New Platforms→New Core Four .\\n \\nBottom Line : No matter how you advertise, you could do it in new\\nways (dif ferent styles of content) or in new places (think other\\nplatforms). Then finally , do a new core four activity altogether .\\nAnd, you guessed it, each of them gets us what we want - more\\nleads.\\n \\nNow , this is much harder in practice, which is why I exhaust\\n‘more, better ’ first. But at a certain point you have to expand to\\n‘new’ placements, platforms, and core four activities to let more\\npeople know about your stuf f.\\n \\nAction Step : Exhaust more better first. Once you can’ t do\\nanymore, any better ( meaning the returns are lower than putting\\nthat same ef fort into a new platform ) try new . Use this rough order:\\nnew placement, new platform, new core four activity . Get it going.\\nMeasure how you do. And scale up from there using more–better .\\nThen, rinse and repeat.\\n \\n \\n‘Mor e Better New’ Summary\\n \\nFirst, you do way mor e  of the advertising that works until it\\n“breaks.” Then, the next dr op off point becomes obvious . Then you\\nkeep that level of advertising up while you go back, fix the\\nconstraint, and make it better . So really , better  and mor e  work with\\neach other more than they work separately . The first question I\\nusually ask myself before we invest in a company that needs to get\\nmore customers is “What’ s stopping them from doing ten times\\nwhat they’re currently doing?” Sometimes, nothing– so we just do\\nmor e . Other times we just need to make something better  first. So\\nanswer that question and you’ll know what to do next.\\n \\nOnly once you’ve exhausted more–better do the real returns come\\nfrom doing new . First, go with new ad placements on a platform\\nyou know . Second, go with placements you know on a new\\nplatform. Then, once you get the hang of that new platform, use\\nnew placements on it. Once you exhaust that, you can add a new\\ncore four activity on top of what you currently do. That gives you\\nmy simple, r eal-world way , I put the core four on steroids to get\\neven more leads.\\n \\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nAdvertising  is the pr ocess of making known . It’ s what we do to let\\nstrangers know about the stuf f we sell. Now , we solved ‘the stuf f ’\\nproblem with your lead magnet or of fer . But to get them to turn\\ninto engaged leads, you have to tell them about it . So we spent this\\nsection going over the only four ways a single person  can\\nadvertise–let other people know about their stuf f. And to do it, you\\ntrade either time, money , or both. And when you do it, you can\\nadvertise to people who know you (warm) or you can advertise to\\nstrangers (cold). Y ou can advertise publicly (content/ads) or\\nprivately (outreach).\\n \\nAs far as what to do when? Whenever I build a business I think\\nabout it this way–after I do warm outreach to get my pool of\\ncustomers going–if I have more time than money , I move to\\nposting content. If I have more money than time, I go with cold\\noutreach or running ads.\\n \\nBut remember , you only need to do one  to get engaged leads. So,\\njust pick one . Then, max it out . Do more. Do better . Do new . And,\\nall the advertising methods compound together . The money ,\\nsystems, and experience you earned from the prior method will\\nhelp you master the next. A business that posts free content and\\nruns paid ads will get more out of their ads and  their content than a\\nbusiness that does only one or the other . A business that does cold\\noutreach and makes content will get more from their cold outreach\\nand  work their warm leads better than one that does only one.\\nEvery combination of the core four advertising activities boost\\neach other in some way .\\n \\nAnd as a personal note, I’ve done ‘em all. I built my first\\nbusiness of f posting content and warm outreach. I built my gyms\\nof f free content and paid ads. I built Gym Launch of f paid ads and\\ncold outreach. I built Prestige Labs of f af filiates (which we cover\\nin Section IV). I built ALAN of f paid ads and af filiates (also\\nSection IV). I built Acquisition.com of f posting content. There are\\nmany ways to get engaged leads. If you master one, you will be\\nable to feed yourself for the rest of your life. They all work if you\\ndo.\\n \\n \\nNext Up\\n \\nIf you follow the steps in this book, you’ll run out of hours in the\\nday . Y ou won’ t be able to do any more, any better… let alone add\\nanything new! So you’ll need help on your journey to the land of\\nendless leads. Y ou’ll need allies. Those allies come in four\\ndif ferent flavors. And since there are more of them than there are\\nof you, they’re the key to getting there. So let’ s go get them.\\n \\n \\n\\nS e c t i o n  I V :  G e t  L e a d  G e t t e r s\\nGet people who get you more leads\\n \\n“Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it,\\nand I shall move the world.”              - Ar chimedes\\n \\n \\nBuilding A $100M Lead Machine Is All About Leverage\\n \\nAn old lady can lift a semi-truck with a long enough lever . The\\nstrongest man in the world, without one, can’ t . The length of the\\nlever determines how much someone can lift. This is leverage. W e\\ncan use the principle of leverage in advertising. Let me explain:\\n \\n \\nSomeone with internet can send a message to millions of people at\\nonce. Someone writing postcards by hand can’ t . The internet\\nallows us to reach more people for the same time spent. So, it’ s\\nhigher leverage.\\n \\nThat means leverage boils down to how much we get for the time\\nwe spend getting it. So we want to use higher leverage activities to\\nget what we want. More stuf f we want. Less time getting it. Good.\\n \\nAnd we want leads.  Lots of leads.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLead Getters Give Y ou Leverage\\n \\n \\nPeople can find out about the stuf f we sell from two sources. W e\\ncan let them know using the core four . Or , other people  can let\\nthem know using the core four . I call these other people lead\\ngetters . When other people do it for us, we save time. That means\\nwe get more engaged leads for less work. Leverage baby .\\n \\n \\nImagine four scenarios:\\n \\nScenario #1: Y ou ar e  the lead getter .  Y ou do the core four all day\\neveryday by yourself. Y ou get enough leads to pay the bills.\\n \\n \\nW ork: HIGH Leads: LOW Leverage: LOW\\n \\nScenario #2: Y ou get  a lead getter .  Y ou get a lead getter to do the\\ncore four on your behalf. Now , the lead getter brings enough leads\\nto pay the bills without you advertising. Y ou work less than\\nscenario #1 and get the same number of leads.\\n \\n \\nW ork: LOW . Leads: LOW . Leverage: HIGH.\\n \\nScenario #3: Y ou get lots of lead getters.  Y ou spend all your time\\ngetting other lead getters. Y our leads go up every time you get\\nanother one.  Y ou work all day everyday , but you get way more\\nleads than you did when it was just you. Y ou work more than\\nscenario #2 but get way  more leads.\\n \\n \\nW ork: HIGH. Leads: HIGH. Leverage: HIGHER.\\n \\nScenario #4: Y ou get a lead getter who gets lead getters.  Y ou\\nrecruit somebody who recruits other people to advertise on your\\nbehalf. They get more lead getters every month. Y ou only had to\\nwork to get the first lead getter once , but his leads continue\\nclimbing without you working. Y ou works less than scenario #3,\\nand you get more leads each and every month.\\n \\n \\nW ork: LOW . Leads: HIGH. Leverage: HIGHEST .\\n \\nNow you’ve got the makings of a $100M Leads  machine.\\n \\n\\n \\nOutline of The “Lead Getters” Section\\n \\nThe lead getters aren’ t part of the “core four” because they’re not\\nthings you do. Y ou do not ‘do’ af filiates or ‘do’ customer referrals\\nor ‘do’ agencies or ‘do’ employees.  But, you have to do the cor e\\nfour to get them . They come from warm outreach, cold reach outs,\\nposting content, and running paid ads. And once you get them, they\\ndo it for you.\\n \\nSo the core four stacks. One time to get them, and a second time\\nfor when lead getters get engaged leads on your behalf. But it\\ndoesn’ t have to end there. In fact, it shouldn’ t. The process repeats.\\nLead getters can go get lead getters! So we do something once then\\nlead getters can do it forever .\\n \\nBut wait, I thought this book was about getting leads? So am I\\ntrying to get leads? Or do I want lead getters? Answer: Y es. Lead\\ngetters start out as leads, then get interested in the stuf f you sell\\nand become engaged leads like anyone else. The dif ference is they\\nget other people interested in the stuf f you sell, too! And ideally ,\\nevery lead becomes a lead getter .\\n \\nThe following chapters explain, in detail, how to get other people\\nto advertise for you . And, if you want to scale to $100M+, you\\nhave to understand them:\\n \\n#1 Customers - they buy your stuf f then tell other people about it\\nto get you leads.\\n \\n#2 Employees - people in your business that get you leads .\\n \\n#3 Agencies-  businesses with services that get you leads .\\n \\n#4 Affiliates -  businesses who tell their audiences about your stuf f\\nto get you leads.\\n \\n*All four lead getters let other people know about your  stuf f. In\\nother words, all four are higher leverage than you doing it on your\\nown.\\n \\nOnce you do understand the four lead getters, you can build a lead\\ngetting machine for every company you start for the rest of your\\nlife. I’ll break down how I use all four lead getters. How each is\\ndif ferent. How to work with them. When to use them. Best\\npractices. And how to measure your progress along the way . At the\\nend of this section, you will understand how to get other people to\\nbring you more leads than you can possibly imagine.\\n \\nAnd since we already use the core four to get customers, let’ s start\\nwith something we can do right now–get those customers to refer\\nmore customers.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n# 1  C u s t o m e r  R e f e r r a l s  -  W o r d  o f  M o u t h\\n“The best sour ce of new work, is the work on your desk” - Charlie\\nMunger\\n \\n \\nOctober 2019.\\n \\nLeila and I sat together on her parents’ living room couch. The one\\nshe watched movies on as a kid. The faded edges of the cof fee\\ntable begged us to kick our feet up. W e balanced laptops on our\\nthighs. Extension cords snaked around the couch to outlets down\\nthe hall. Her stepmother clanged in the kitchen. This was not  a\\nwork environment. But, we made due.\\n \\nT wo years earlier , I lost everything and met her parents on the\\nsame weekend…\\n \\nHey dad, I met this guy on the internet. He lost everything and has\\nno money . But don’ t worry , I quit my job and moved in with him to\\nhelp with his next big business idea. By the way , can we crash her e\\nfor a while?’\\n \\n… Gr eat  first impression, Alex.\\n \\nBut a lot had changed since then. W e were multi-millionaires now .\\nW e made enough to buy her childhood home in cash. Every week.\\n \\nLeila reviewed reports from our department heads. Oh yeah, we\\nhad executives now , too.\\n \\n“Hey , sales numbers look a little soft this week.” she said.\\n \\n“Really? How many did we close?”\\n \\n“Fifteen. And sales started dipping last week too. Is there anything\\ndif ferent on your end?”\\n \\n“I don\\'t know . Let me check.” I logged into Facebook’ s advertising\\nportal. Red rejection notifications filled the screen.\\n \\n“W elp. That’ll do it” I said.\\n \\n“What? What happened?”\\n \\n“All the ads got shut of f.”\\n \\n“W ell…that’ s a problem. When do you think you can get them\\nback up?”\\n \\n“It’ll take a day or two to get a new campaign started.”\\n \\nI squinted at the screen. Something even more alarming jumped at\\nme. Facebook r ejected the ads two weeks ago. I acted like nothing\\nwas wrong.\\n \\n“So we closed 15 this week, and how many the week before?” I\\nasked.\\n \\n“21”\\n \\n“W ell, I’ve got good news and I’ve got bad news.”\\n \\n“Uhh…Ok…”\\n \\n“The bad news is…the ads got shut of f two weeks ago, so that\\nexplains the dip. The good news is…our product is so good that\\nwe’re still doing $500,000 a week from word of mouth alone.\\n \\n“Y ou ignored the ads for two weeks!?” She had oh no you didn’ t\\nwritten all over her face.\\n \\nI shrugged with a sheepish grin. “Y ou still love me, right?”\\n \\nW e busted out laughing at the absurdity of it all.\\n \\nThose two years were insane. The amount of money we were\\nmaking didn\\'t make sense. W e didn’ t comprehend how much until\\nyears later . W e were just grateful to be doing this together , flaws\\nand all. And this accidental stretch without running paid ads made\\nsomething very clear: Our customers wer e telling their friends.\\n \\n \\n**A few months later**\\n \\nI stood on stage and looked out over the 700+ gym owner\\naudience. Everyone paid $42,000 to be there. All wore black “Gym\\nLord” t-shirts and stick-on mustaches. It. W as. Nuts.\\n \\nI was mid-presentation, explaining how excellent service generates\\nleads through word of mouth. All the while, I obsessed over\\nwhether the money we made during two weeks without running\\npaid ads was a fluke. Feeling confident, I paused the presentation.\\nT ime to find out :\\n \\n“Alright, just to show you how important this is, who here learned\\nabout Gym Launch from another gym owner? Raise your hand.”\\nAs soon as the words left my lips, I felt instant regret. What if no\\none raises their hand? What if our gr owth was all for ced? I’m such\\nan idiot.\\n \\nI looked around the room with my arm raised like a monkey . The\\nroom stood still. Oh no.\\n \\nThen…a few gym owners raised their hands. That doesn’ t look\\ngr eat, but it could be worse . Then, more. Thank God. Then, more.\\nThen, a wave  of hands. Holy cow . People looked to their sides and\\nbehind them. It was almost the entir e r oom . I let the moment sink\\nin for all of us. I’ll never for get it. I knew we had good word of\\nmouth, but not this  good.\\n \\n“That” I said, “is the power of word of mouth.”\\n \\n***\\n \\nI know you weren’ t there when Leila and I realized we were\\nmaking $500,000+ per week from word of mouth. I know you\\nweren’ t there to see $30M in customers say someone referred\\nthem. The first time I realized the power of referrals - it was by\\naccident . Seeing how much it made me, I studied what had gone\\nright. I wanted to make sure I could recreate it on purpose . For me\\nto transfer that ability to you, I have to transfer the beliefs that\\ncreated it. And these experiences formed those beliefs. This is why\\nI shar e them.\\n \\nPeople copied our of fers, ads, and lead magnets. They copied our\\nlanding pages, emails, and sales scripts. They copied everything\\nthey could–but they did it with little success. They think it’ s about\\n\"advertising,\" and it is. But the best  advertising is a happy\\ncustomer . An amazing product turns every customer into a lead\\ngetter .\\n \\nThe world loses trust by the second. Every day , more customers do\\ntheir research. They arm themselves with information to make\\npurchasing decisions. As well they should. So to play at higher\\nlevels, we need our product to not only deliver ... but  delight .\\nCustomers must get so much value  it compels them to tell other\\npeople about us. The good news is, once you know how , it’ s easier\\nthan you think.\\n \\nIn this chapter , I explain how to get the lowest cost, highest profit,\\nand best quality leads out there: referrals.\\n \\n \\nHow Referrals W ork\\n \\nA referral happens when somebody , a referrer , sends an engaged\\nlead to your business. Anyone can refer , but the best referrals come\\nfrom your customers. So this chapter focuses on getting more\\nreferrals from your customers.\\n \\nHow Referrals Gr ow Y our Business\\n \\nReferrals are important because they grow your business in two\\nways:\\n \\n1 . They’r e worth mor e (higher L TGP).  Referrals buy more\\nexpensive stuf f and buy it more times. They also tend to pay in\\ncash upfront. Lovely .\\n \\n2 . They cost less (lower CAC) . If one customer sends you another\\ncustomer because they like your stuf f, that new customer costs\\nyou nothing. And free customers are cheaper than customers that\\ncost money . So free customers = good.\\n \\nBut what does this stuf f really mean? Check this out…imagine you\\nhad an L TGP to CAC ratio of 4 to 1. That means it costs twenty-\\nfive percent of your lifetime gross profit of one customer to get\\nanother . Not bad. But now imagine if every customer br ought you\\ntwo mor e customers.  Y ou’d now have an L TGP to CAC ratio of 12\\nto 1– you’d use just over 8.3% of your lifetime gross profit to get a\\nnew customer . So you get three customers for the price of one.\\nNow we’re talking. Hooray . What a deal! On top of that, r eferrals\\nar e exponential . Let me explain.\\n \\n \\nThe number of engaged leads you get from the core four depends\\non how much  you do them. The inputs to outputs have pretty linear\\nrelationships. If you do 100 reach outs you get engaged leads. If\\nyou double it, your leads roughly double. If you spend $100 on\\nads, you get engaged leads. If you double it, your leads roughly\\ndouble. So no matter how well you advertise, how much you get\\ndepends on how much you do. And that’ s great. But with word of\\nmouth, we can do even better . W ith word of mouth, one customer\\nbrings two. T wo bring four . Four bring eight. And so forth. It’ s not\\nlinear , it’ s exponential .\\n \\nNothing scales like wor d of mouth.  W ant to know why so few\\npeople scale by word of mouth? They lose customers faster than\\nthey get them. Look at the referral growth equation to see it in\\naction. Referrals (in) minus churned customers (out).\\n \\n \\nIf referrals are greater than churn: you grow without any other\\nadvertising (yay!)\\n \\nIf referrals are equal to churn: you need other advertising to\\ngrow your business (meh)\\n \\nIf referrals are less than churn: you’ve got to advertise to break\\neven (boo - most folks)\\n \\nThis gets nutty when you look at percentages. If the percentage of\\nreferrals every month is bigger than the percentage of customers\\nwho leave, your business compounds every month. Y ou’d have to\\nspend that much more money on ads, do that many more reach\\nouts, or post that much more content just to maintain that growth.\\nY ou eventually hit a wall. But with referrals, you can maintain\\ngrowth no matter how big you get . This is how companies like\\nPayPal and Dropbox exploded into multibillion dollar businesses.\\nI’ll break down their exact strategies later in the chapter .\\n \\nOn the other hand, small businesses barely scrape by because they\\nhave about the same customers exiting as they do entering. A\\nhamster wheel of death. Here’ s why…\\n \\n \\nT wo Reasons Most Businesses Don’t Get Referrals\\n \\nMost businesses don’ t get referrals for two reasons. First, their\\nproduct isn’ t as good as they think it is. Second, they don’ t ask for\\nthem.\\n \\n \\nProblem #1: The Product Isn’ t Good Enough\\n \\n“Everyone loves our stuff, we just need to get the wor d out!”  - says\\nevery small business owner with a product that’ s not as good as\\nthey think it is.\\n \\nI’m gonna take of f my nice guy hat for a second. If your product\\nwere exceptional, people would already know about it and you’d\\nhave more business than you could handle. So if you sell direct to\\nconsumers and they are not bringing you more customers, your\\nproduct has room to improve.\\n \\nI like to ask myself: “Why are my customers too embarrassed to\\ntell everyone they know about my product?” It may be okay , but\\nit’ s unr emarkable , as in - not worthy of remark.\\n \\nIn fact, most of the stuf f I pay for , kind of sucks. My pool guy\\nfor gets stuf f half the time. My landscapers make tons of noise at\\nthe worst hours. My cleaners routinely put my clothes in my wife\\'s\\ncloset (I guess that’ s what I get for extra schmedium t-shirts). The\\nlist goes on.\\n \\nBusiness owners wonder why they don’ t get referrals. The answer\\nis right in front of them. They\\'r e just not good enough.  Let me\\nshow you how I think about it:\\n \\n \\nPrice is what you char ge. V alue is what they get. The dif ference\\nbetween price and value is goodwill .\\n \\nThis means that price not only communicates value, but it’ s also\\nhow we judge  value. Economics dorks call it ‘customer surplus’.\\nBut I’m just gonna call it goodwill. Y ou want lots of goodwill. Lots\\nof goodwill creates word of mouth. W ord of mouth means\\nreferrals.\\n \\nThere are two ways to build goodwill with your customers. Y ou\\ncan lower your price or you can give more value. After all, if you\\nlower the price of your product enough, people would line up to\\nget it. But you’d probably lose money . So, lowering the price is, at\\nbest, a temporary solution. Y ou can only lower the price so much\\nfor so long. And, as marketing legend Rory Sutherland says, “Any\\nfool can sell something for less.”\\n \\nSo, to build goodwill to get referrals, the question isn’ t how do we\\nlower our price but, how do we give more value?\\n \\n \\nSix W ays T o Get Mor e Referrals By Giving  Mor e V alue\\n \\nThere are six ways I get referrals by giving more value. And it just\\nso happens to map to the parts of an ad. Neat-o.\\n \\n1 . Call Outs → Sell Better Customers\\n \\n2 . Dream Outcome → Set Better Expectations\\n \\n3 . Increase Perceived Likelihood of Achievement → Get More\\nPeople Better Results\\n \\n4 . Decrease T ime Delay → Get Faster Results\\n \\n5 . Decrease Ef fort and Sacrifice → Keep Making Y our Stuf f Better\\n \\n6 . Call to Action → T ell Them What T o Buy Next\\n \\n \\n1 . Call outs → Sell Better Customers.  W e want to sell better customers\\nbecause they get the most value from our products. Customers that get\\nthe most value have the most goodwill.  And the customers that have\\nthe most goodwill are most likely to refer . Y es, it’ s that simple. Let me\\ngive you a real-life example:\\n \\nW e have a portfolio company that did public relations for generic\\nsmall businesses. They had a lot of sales, but they had a lot of churn.\\nSo they plateaued. They didn’ t grow for years.\\n \\nT o see what we could do, we looked at their lowest churning\\ncustomers to see if they had anything in common - they did. They\\nwere all in a specific niche and looking to raise funding from\\ninvestors. So the solution looked obvious–get more of them! But the\\nfounder had a big worry–these customers were only fifteen percent of\\nhis business. If he changed his tar geting, and it failed, he would lose\\neighty-five percent of his business(!). But the business wasn’ t growing\\nanyway . A tough situation for any entrepreneur . But, after reviewing\\nthe data many times, he agreed to change the advertising call outs to\\nmatch this narr ower , “perfect fit” customer .\\n \\nThe results: The company broke through its plateau. They grew for\\nthe first time in years - and now on track to adding millions per\\nmonth . Plus, their cost of advertising–a huge expense for their\\nstagnating business–went down. They got even cheaper leads  since\\nthey could be more specific with their messaging. But not only that,\\nthe cheaper leads got even more value from the product because it was\\nmeant for them . And those customers, because they had more\\ngoodwill toward the business, started referring like clockwork.\\n \\nAction Step:  Incr ease the quality of the pr ospect, and you’ll incr ease\\nthe quality of the pr oduct.  Figure out what your most successful\\ncustomers have in common. Use those similarities to tar get a new\\naudience that has the greatest chance of getting the most value. Then,\\nsell only  people who meet those new criteria. Set yourself up to build\\nmore goodwill. More goodwill means more referrals.\\n\\n \\n2 . Dr eam Outcome→Set Better Expectations:  The fastest, easiest, and\\ncheapest way to make your product remarkable - make it better than\\nthey expect. And that\\'s easier than you might think because you  set the\\nexpectations.\\n \\n \\nHave you ever had a stranger tell you a new movie was awesome?\\nThen you go see it and think ‘that wasn’ t as good as I expected.’ On\\nthe flip side, have you ever had someone tell you a movie was terrible,\\nthen you ended up seeing it anyways and thought ‘That wasn’ t as bad\\nas I expected.’ Our expectations of an experience can dramatically\\naf fect the experience itself. W e can increase goodwill by lowering\\nexpectations. It gives us room to overdeliver .\\n \\nIn the beginning, I promised everything and the kitchen sink to get\\npeople to buy . Fulfilling on that turned into a nightmare. So, I began\\ninching down my promises while maintaining quality . It gave me\\nmore room to overdeliver and I netted a major benefit - referrals.\\nCustomer expectations are fickle. That’ s why we set the expectations\\nfor them. And if we set those expectations, then we can exceed them.\\n \\nAction Step:  Slowly lower the promises you make when making\\nof fers. Keep lowering them until your close rates lower . At that point,\\nstop. This maximizes how many customers you get and  the goodwill\\nyou build with them. Maximized customers and more goodwill means\\nmore referrals.\\n \\n \\n3 . Incr ease Per ceived Likelihood of Achievement → Get Mor e\\nPeople Better Results:\\nThe customers with the best results get the most value from your\\nproduct. Figure out what they do to get the most value, and you can\\nhelp your other customers do the same. T wo steps ago, to sell better\\ncustomers, we figured out who the best ones wer e . So now , to get\\neveryone the best results, we figure out what the best ones did .\\n \\nLet me show you what it looked like at Gym Launch. W e started by\\ntracking customer activities. Speed to running their first paid ad.\\nSpeed to their first sale. Their attendance on calls. Etc. Then, we\\ncompared the activities of our average  customers to the activities of\\nour best  customers. W e found out something huge. If a gym owner ran\\npaid ads and made a sale in the first seven days, their L TGP tripled .\\nOnce we realized this, we focused on getting everyone  to launch ads\\nand make sales in the first seven days. The results of our average\\ncustomers skyrocketed. More customers, more testimonials and more\\nreferrals followed.\\n \\nHere’ s the process I use to get more people better results:\\n \\nStep #1: Survey customers to find the ones who got the best results.\\n \\nStep #2: Interview them to find out what they did dif ferently .\\n \\nStep #3: Look at the actions  they had in common.\\n \\nStep #4: Force new customers to repeat the actions that got the best\\nresults.\\n \\nStep #5: Measure the improvement in average customer results (speed\\nand outcome)\\n \\nStep #6: Match the conditions of your guarantee to the actions that\\nget the best results to get more people to do them.\\n \\n \\n \\nAction Steps:  Figure out what the best people did. Then get everyone\\nto do it. Make your guarantees around the actions that create the most\\nsuccess. More success. More goodwill. More referrals.\\n \\n4 . Decr ease T ime Delay→Make Faster W ins:  I define a “win” as any\\npositive experience a customer has. Faster wins increase their\\nperception of speed, increase the likelihood they’ll stick, and increase\\nhow much they trust you. T riple win. T o make wins feel  faster , we\\ngive them wins mor e often . \\n \\nLet’ s imagine you have a product that takes a week to deliver . The\\ncustomer can get one win at the end of that week or win every day\\nwith daily progress updates. Same amount of progress, seven times\\nthe wins. On top of that, if someone said seven things would happen,\\nand all seven do, I trust them even more. Referring a friend is now\\nlower risk since seven promises were made, and all seven were kept.\\n \\nHere’ s five ways I make wins happen faster in the real world:\\n \\n1 . If I have seven small things to deliver , I deliver them at\\nshorter intervals rather than all at once. \\n \\n2 . Updates are wins. If it’ s a bigger project, I share progress\\nupdates as frequently as possible. Y ou can never give\\nsomeone too much good news. And regular updates, progress\\nor not, is better than leaving your customers hanging.\\n \\n3 . Customers form their lasting impression of a business within\\nthe first forty-eight hours after they buy . Force a good\\nimpression. Force as many wins as you can in that window .\\nSet many expectations. Meet many expectations. Repeat. \\n \\n4 . They should always know the next time they’ll hear from\\nyou. I got a slick saying from a public CEO friend of mine -\\nBAMF AM: Book-A-Meeting-From-A-Meeting. Again, never\\nleave a customer in no man’ s land. They should always know\\nwhat happens… next . \\n \\n5 . Never expect customers to for give you. Ever . So act like it.\\nFor example, you can deliver early , but never late. I add fifty\\npercent to my timelines so I always deliver early . That makes\\n“on time” for me early  for them. \\n \\nAction step:  Break down outcomes into the smallest possible\\nincrement. Communicate as often as reasonable (even if there is no\\nprogress, update them). Set timelines with breathing room. Deliver\\nearly . More customer wins means more goodwill. And more goodwill\\nmeans more referrals.\\n \\n \\n5 . Decr ease Effort & Sacrifice → Keep Making Y our Stuff Better:  If\\nthe customer does less stuf f they hate to benefit from your product,\\nyou’ve made it better . If the customer gives up fewer things they love\\nto benefit from your product, you’ve made it better . And there’ s no\\nsuch thing as a perfect product. Y ou can always  make it better . And\\nthe easier you make it for them to benefit, the more goodwill you get,\\nand the more likely they’ll refer . Here’ s my process to keep making\\nmy stuf f better .\\n \\nStep #1: Use customer service data, surveys, and reviews to find\\nthe most common problem with your product.\\n \\nStep #2: Figure out your fix. T o get a headstart, get feedback from\\nthe customers who made your product work for them\\ndespite the problem it has.\\n \\nStep #3: Use that feedback to improve your product.\\n \\nStep #4: Give the new version to a small group of your (struggling)\\ncustomers.\\n \\nStep #5: Get your next round of feedback. If you solved the\\noriginal problem, then roll it out to all customers. If it\\ndidn’ t, go back to step #2.\\n \\nStep #6: Move to the next most common problem and repeat the\\nprocess. Do this until the end of time.\\n \\nAction Step:  Keep making your stuf f better . Survey . Make changes.\\nImplement. Measure. Repeat. I run this process every month. Set this\\nas a recurring monthly process. A product that takes less ef fort and\\nfewer sacrifices means more goodwill. And more goodwill means\\nmore referrals.\\n \\n \\n6. Call T o Action→ T ell Them What T o Buy Next:  If you have an\\namazing product, they’ll want more. Y ou have to satisfy their desire to\\nbuy . If you don’ t, they’ll still buy… but fr om someone else . Don’ t let\\nthat happen. Sell them again. Y ou can either sell them a new thing or\\nmore of the thing they just bought. In either case, you’ll get even\\nmore goodwill and extend the lifetime of the customer . And besides,\\nthe more stuf f they can buy , the more stuf f they can refer their friends\\nto.\\n \\nFor example, in a weight loss company we know , lots of customers\\nreferred friends to their first tier product. But, some didn\\'t. A lot of\\nthose customers who didn\\'t refer to the first product, when they\\nbought their more expensive thing, referred their friends to that! So\\nyou gotta keep selling.\\n \\nIn my experience, people obsess over their front end of fers. And that\\nmakes sense. But then they neglect the back end and customers fall\\noff . And customers that fall of f your product are unlikely to refer - so\\nkeep selling them so they don’ t.\\n \\nAction Step:  T reat every customer like it\\'s the first time you\\'ve sold\\nthem. Make sure your next of fer is more compelling than your first.\\nRemind them to buy more after each big win. More things to buy\\nmeans more opportunities to add even more value. More value means\\nmore goodwill. And more goodwill means, you guessed it, more\\nreferrals.\\n \\n \\nOne Question to Rule Them All\\n \\nLet’ s consolidate these six steps into one thought experiment. I\\nencourage you to try it out with your team. Here it is:\\n \\nY ou’ve lost all your customers but one. The gods of advertising ban\\nyou fr om doing the cor e four and decr ee:\\n \\n-All customers must come fr om this one customer .\\n \\n-V iolate our terms and we will destr oy your business, and every\\nother business you start, for eternity .\\n \\nT ough break. But, the question remains, how would you treat this\\ncustomer?  What would you do to make their experience so\\nvaluable  they  would  send all their friends? What kind of results\\nwould they need to get? What would their onboarding be? What\\ntype of customer would you pick? Think about it. W rite it out. Y our\\nbusiness depends on it. Then… do it :)\\n \\nStart acting like the advertising gods will revoke your core four\\nprivileges at any moment. Soon you’ll see you have no choice but\\nto start adding more value to get more customer referrals.\\n \\nNow that we covered that. Do you wanna know how you can get\\neven mor e  referrals? →Ask for them.\\n \\n \\nReferrals: Ask For Them\\n \\nDo you know why businesses have so few referrals compared to\\nwhat they could have? They never ask for them. Y our customers,\\nlike any audience, can only know what to do if you tell them.\\n \\nNow , I’ve tried a lot  of referral strategies. Most failed. And I\\nstruggled until I had this epiphany: Asking for referrals only works\\nwhen you treat it like an of fer .  The r eferrals come when you show\\nthe value the customer gets when they r efer their friends.  Let me\\ngive you two quick case studies to show the power of asking for\\nreferrals:\\n \\nCase Study #1 : Dropbox gave free storage to customers and free\\nstorage to  the friends they referred. The referral program went viral\\nand they 39 x\\'d their business in fifteen months.\\n \\n \\nCase Study #2 : Paypal gave $10 in credit to customers and  $10 to\\nthe friends they referred. W ithin two years, the program helped\\nthem reach a million users, and six years later , they hit 100 million\\nusers. They still use it today .\\n \\nSo how do we harness the same viral growth in our own small\\nbusinesses? W e do what they did. W e ask for it.\\n \\nSeven W ays T o Ask  For Referrals\\n \\nThere are three components to a referral program: how you give\\nthe incentive, what you incentivize with, and how you ask. Rather\\nthan give you a hundred variations that may or may not work, here\\nare the seven combos that worked best for me:\\n \\n1)  One-Sided Referral Benefit : I’d rather pay customers than a\\nplatform any day of the week. Pay your average cost to acquire a\\ncustomer (CAC) to the referrer or the friend. Make them aware of\\nthe incentive.\\n \\nEx: Imagine it costs $200 to get a new customer . Ask the current\\ncustomer to make an actual three-way introduction to a friend–via\\ncall, SMS, or email. Not just a name and number . Also, ask them to\\ndo it right when they buy…don’ t wait. Then, write them a check\\nfor $200 when their friend signs up OR  give their friend $200 of f.\\n \\nEx: This works great for spouses because they both basically get\\nthe benefit. Always ask for the spouse & give a household\\ndiscount.\\n \\n2)  T wo-Sided Referral Benefits : This is what Dropbox and PayPal\\nused. W e pay our CAC to both parties. Half goes to the referrer (in\\ncredit or cash) and half goes to the friend (in credit). This way , they\\nboth  benefit.\\n \\nEx: W e sell $500 programs. Our cost to get a customer is $200. For\\nevery friend someone refers, we give them $100 cash, and give\\ntheir friend $100 of f signing up. Good for up to 3 friends. This\\nworked really well for my local businesses.\\n \\n\\n \\n3) Ask For A Referral Right When They Buy:  On the sales contract or\\ncheckout page, ask for some names and phone numbers of people\\nthey’d like to do this with . Show them how they  will get better\\nresults when they do it with a friend.\\n \\nEx: I had a new salesman come into one of my portfolio companies\\nand shatter all the sales records for an upcoming event. W e didn’ t\\nknow what was going on. So I hopped on the phone with him - how\\nar e you selling mor e tickets than everyone else ? He shrugged and\\nsaid, “I’m doing the same thing as everyone else. I just make sure I\\nask them who else they’d want to have come with them. Then ask\\nthem to introduce me.” Half  his sales were referrals. So simple, and\\nyet no one does it .\\n \\nScripting example: People who do our pr ogram with someone else\\ntend to get 3x the r esults. Who else could you do this pr ogram\\nwith?\\n \\n \\n4) Add Referrals As A Negotiation Chip : On top of that, you can ask\\nfor referrals as a way to negotiate a lower price. In other words, if\\nsomeone wants to pay $400 and your price is $500, you can give\\nthem the discount in exchange for  an introduction to three friends.\\nY ou can ethically char ge a dif ferent price for the same thing\\nbecause you changed the terms of the sale.\\n \\nEx: “I can’ t do anything less than $500 down, but if you make a 3-\\nway text introduction to a few of your friends right now , I’d be\\nhappy to cut that initiation fee.”\\n \\nAnd to address the question you didn’ t ask - if a full-priced\\ncustomer finds out you gave someone else a discount (which I’ve\\nhad happen), here’ s all you say: “Y ea - Stacy got $100 off because\\nshe r eferr ed thr ee friends. I\\'m happy to give you $100 if you r efer\\nme thr ee friends. Who do you have in mind?”  They either back of f\\nor they give you three friends. W in win.\\n \\n5) Referral Events:  Where people get points, credits, dollars or even\\njust bragging rights for bringing friends within an explicit time\\nperiod. Referral events typically last from one to four weeks.\\nWhenever you run one of these events, sell everyone on the\\nbenefits of working with others. Use some stats (internal or\\nexternal) to show high success rates and the selfish benefit to\\nbringing friends. I use names like:\\n \\n“Bring-a-friend” Promotion\\n \\n“Spouse Challenge” Promotion\\n \\n“Accountability Buddy” Promotion\\n \\n“Coach Challenge” Promotion where you create teams with\\nyour employees and customers. This works well in coaching\\nstyle businesses.\\n \\n6) Ongoing Referral Programs : Instead of running a limited duration\\nreferral promotion, you talk about the benefits of doing things with\\nothers all the time. Think: in your free content, outreach, paid ads,\\netc. After a buddy did this, he saw a 33% boost in total  sign ups.\\nFor context, he had 1,000,000 customers buy tickets to his virtual\\nevent and 250,000 of them were referred…this stuf f works.\\n \\n7) Unlockable Referral Bonuses : Create bonuses for people who 1)\\nrefer and 2) leave a testimonial. A few examples: Unlock VIP\\nbonuses, courses, tokens, status, training, merchandise, service\\nlevels, premium support, additional hours of service, etc. \\n \\nUnlockable referral bonuses work well if you don’ t like paying out\\ncash. The bonuses can also be for both  parties if you like (since\\nthey cost you less than cash). V isit the lead magnet section for\\nsome extra inspiration. As always, the more insane you make the\\nof fer , the more people will refer . If you want them to refer , make it\\nso good they’d be stupid not to.\\n \\n \\nY ou’r e Only Limited By Y our Cr eativity\\n \\nHere’ s what it looks like to combine a few of the strategies above\\ninto a killer referral promotion.\\n \\nGive everyone a gift card for one-third the cost of their program.\\nT ell them they can give it to a friend of theirs if they sign up with\\nthem. Give the gift card an expiration date within seven to fourteen\\ndays from the date you give it to them→it’ll force them to use it.\\nThis gives the referrer status when they give it to their friend.\\nRather than saying “hey join my program for $2000 of f” they say ,\\n“I got this gift card for $2000. Do you want it? I don’ t want to\\nwaste it.” It’ s seen as a much bigger deal for them and you.\\n \\nY ou can still use the three-way introduction with this tactic. Then\\ntext a picture of the gift card. Bonus points if you write the friend’ s\\nname on it before texting the picture. It makes it feel personalized\\nand gives you a legitimate reason for asking for their friend’ s name\\n(wink).\\n \\nPS - Y ou can also sell the gift cards at ninety percent of f as\\npurchasable gifts (only for friends of customers). The referrer\\nlooks like they spent a lot of money , and you get paid to get new\\ncustomers.  I can hardly think of a better way to make money .\\nAgain, the only limit is your creativity .\\n \\n \\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nReferrals aren’ t an advertising method you can “do.”  It’ s not one\\ntrick or hack (although we learned some of those). It’ s a  way of\\ndoing business . And it starts with you .\\n \\nAfter all, referring is always a risk for the customer . They risk their\\ngoodwill with their friend in the hopes  of getting more by showing\\nthem something cool (your stuf f). So customers only  refer when\\nthey think it’ s very likely their friend will have a good experience.\\nIn other words, when the benefits to them personally outweigh the\\nrisk of hurting the relationship with their friend. So we add benefits\\nfor them and their friends with incentives and we lower the risk by\\nbuilding goodwill (showing we deliver on our promises). And we\\ndo that by using the six ways to give your customers more value.\\nNow don’ t get me wrong, building goodwill does a fantastic job of\\ngetting referrals on its own. But if we’re smart, which we are, we\\ncapitalize on that goodwill, so we can get even more referrals, by\\nusing the seven ways to ask for them. Whew!\\n \\nSo give more than you get and you’ll never go hungry again. This\\nis how we tr eat our customers . Do this, and you can monetize\\ngoodwill  forever . T o keep this in perspective, I always remind\\nmyself: I am compensated tomorr ow for the value I pr ovide today .\\n \\n \\nAction Items\\n \\nFigure out your referral percentages and churn percentages to set a\\nbaseline. Implement the six “giving value” steps to build goodwill.\\nThen capitalize on that goodwill, using one or more of the seven\\nways to ask for referrals.\\n \\n \\nNext Up…\\n \\nSo now we have to figure out how to scale a team. It looks like\\nwe’ll have to call out potential teammates, show them the value of\\njoining the team, then ask them to join. W ait… that sounds\\nfamiliar . But seriously , if you really want a $100M leads machine,\\nbuckle up. The most valuable chapter in the book is coming up\\nnext - employees . For real, this isn’ t a boring chapter , and you’re\\ngonna need them if you wanna make the big money .\\n \\n \\n\\n# 2  E m p l o y e e s\\n“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far , go\\ntogether” - African Pr overb\\n \\n \\nJune 2021.\\n \\nThe new sales dir ector piped up,  “I know we came in under our\\ngoal again, but I don’ t think we need to change anything, we’ll hit\\nit this quarter .”\\n \\nEyes darted around the room and looked in every direction but\\nmine. The silence was long enough for the executive assistant to\\nmark the topic covered and move on. No wonder we missed our\\ncold outreach goal for the second quarter in a row… nobody\\nchallenged the failure. What, so now we think the thir d time\\'s a\\ncharm?\\n \\n“W ait.” I said. Now everyone  looked in my direction. “I’d like to\\nknow why we didn’ t hit this two quarters in a row . I know we can\\nsell–so if we want to make more sales with cold outreach, then we\\ndo  more cold outreach. What’ s the issue?”\\n \\n“W e lose a rep every four weeks.” the sales director said. Aha.\\n \\n“Ok…Why is our churn so high?”.\\n \\n“I was wondering the same thing, but HR says we’re actually\\nbelow industry average churn for this position.” He continued,\\n“But, by the time we hire and onboard one, another churns out.”\\n \\nI saw the HR director nodding in agreement. Getting warmer .\\n \\n“OK, so the issue is hiring.” I said. “So, what’ s the hiring situation\\nlook like?”\\n \\n“W e hire one out of every four candidates HR pushes to us.”\\n \\n“So if they churn out as fast as we hire them, and you only hire one\\nout of every four , that means you only get like one candidate a\\nweek? ”\\n \\n“Y eah, about that” Almost ther e.\\n \\n“Gotcha” Now I looked at the HR Director , “What’ s the screening\\nsituation look like?”\\n \\n“W e get one qualified candidate per ten screening interviews, give\\nor take.” She said.\\n \\n“So it takes forty  interviews to get a single, low-skill, frontline\\nworker?”\\n \\n“I guess so.” Bingo.\\n \\n“Alright, we need to change things up.” I said. “W e\\'re bottlenecked\\nat the one-on-one screening. Start interviewing in groups and look\\nfor crazies there. Push everyone else with a good work ethic and\\nbasic social skills over to sales. W e can teach the rest. Agreed?”\\nThe team nodded.\\n \\nW ithin six weeks, hiring outpaced churn. Our cold outreach sales\\nincreased in lockstep. By the end of the quarter , cold outreach sales\\nhad doubled, and made up more than half our total sales.\\n \\nThe issue wasn’ t our cold outreach method, skills, or of fer at all.\\nW e just didn’ t have enough people doing  cold outreach.\\n \\n***\\n \\nIf you use the methods in this book, you will see more engaged\\nleads flow into your business. More engaged leads means more\\ncustomers. But as you grow , so does your workload. In due time, it\\nwill take more work than any single person can handle. And you\\ncan solve the problem of too much work for one person  by having\\nmor e people work.  In short, to advertise more, you’ll need more\\nworkers. And this chapter will show you how employees work,\\nwhy they make you wealthy , how to get them, and the method I\\nuse to turn them into lead-getters.\\n \\n \\nHow Employees W ork\\n \\nLead-getting employees  are people working in your business that\\nyou train to get you leads. They get you leads the exact same way\\nyou got your own leads in the beginning. They can run ads, they\\ncan make and post content, and they can do outreach. They can do\\nany advertising you train them to do . So more lead-getting\\nemployees means more engaged leads for your business. It also\\nmeans less work you  have to do to get the leads. More leads and\\nless work? Sign me up! But wait… Not so fast…\\n \\nDon\\'t get me wrong–- employees take work . They just take less\\ntime and work than doing everything on your own.  In my\\nexperience, if you trade forty hours of doing for four hours of\\nmanaging, you work thirty-six hours less. Brilliant. And the best\\npart is, you can make that trade over and over . Y ou can swap 200\\nhours of work per week for twenty hours of management. Then,\\nyou trade the twenty hours of managing for a manager , who costs\\nyou four hours per week to lead. What remains is four hours of\\nwork for 200 hours of lead-getting. Boom.\\n \\nBottom Line:  Employees make a fully functioning enterprise that\\ngrows without you .\\n \\n \\nWhy Employees Make Y ou W ealthy\\n \\nFor your business to run without you, other people need to run it.\\n \\nScenario #1 : Imagine you have a business that makes $5,000,000\\nper year in revenue and $2,000,000 in profit. And, to make that\\nprofit, you have to work around the clock. In this situation, you\\nbasically have a high paying job. But let’ s say you\\'re OK with\\nworking all hours and knowing your business would burn down if\\nyou took a vacation. V acations are for losers anyways (kidding\\n*cough* sort of…). W e still have another important thing to look\\nat…\\n \\nSure, you make a bit of money , but your business isn’ t worth much.\\nIf the business only makes money with you in it, then it’ s a bad\\ninvestment for anyone  else. That may not sound like a big deal\\nright now , but let’ s consider an alternative.\\n \\nScenario #2 : Y our business makes the same $5,000,000 in revenue\\nand $2,000,000 in profit. But there’ s one big dif ference: The\\nbusiness runs  without you. This does two very cool things. One, it\\nturns what used to be a risky job into a valuable asset. And two, it\\nmakes you much  wealthier . Here’ s how:\\n \\nFirst, you get your time back, so you can use that time to invest in\\nyour business, buy other businesses, or take your stinkin’\\nvacations. Second, you become much wealthier because your\\nbusiness is now worth something to someone else . Y ou turned a\\nliability  that relied on you into an asset  you can rely on.\\n \\nIf you have an asset that makes millions of dollars without you  then\\nthat means somebody else could use it to make millions of dollars\\nwithout them . In other words, your business is now a good\\ninvestment.  Then investors looking for assets, like Acquisition.com\\nfor instance, would buy some or all of it from you. And your\\n$2,000,000 in profit per year , especially if it’ s climbing, could\\neasily be worth $10,000,000+, right now . So your business went\\nfrom having almost zer o  value to having $10,000,000 of value. So,\\nlearning how to get other people to do it for you makes a\\n$10,000,000 dif ference to your net worth. I’d say it’ s worth\\nlearning how to do it.\\n \\nReminder: Y ou get rich fr om what you make. Y ou become wealthy\\nfr om what you own . And it took me years to realize this because\\nnot that long ago…\\n \\n \\nEverything I Thought I Knew About Employees W as W r ong\\n \\nHave you ever heard…\\n \\nIf you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself.\\n \\nNo one can do it like I do it.\\n \\nNobody can r eplace me.\\n \\nI have. I said all that stuf f. I lived all that stuf f. For years, every\\ntime I hired somebody , I would compare what they could to what I\\ncould do. In my head, I felt like it was “me against them.” T o\\nsomehow prove I was the more ‘able’ one. W ith my own team!\\nAnd this belief, this way of “leading” people, never made me more\\nmoney .\\n \\nFor business– “nobody can do it but me” and “if you want\\nsomething done right you gotta do it yourself” aren’ t facts…\\nthey’re false. Somebody did similar stuf f before you were around.\\nAnd somebody will continue doing some version of it after you’re\\ngone. In one way or another–everyone is replaceable. It might be\\nby multiple people, technology , or later in time, but everyone  can\\nbe replaced. My suggestion: replace yourself as soon as you can.\\nThen, you can make yourself useful somewhere else. Many other\\npeople figured this out. And so can you.\\n \\nIn the early days, whenever I started a business, I could do stuf f\\nbetter than the people I hired. My entire workforce always ended\\nup looking like a ragtag group of misfits who could kind of  do one\\nof the many things I could do. This got me up and running at first,\\nbut I fell into the trap of believing I was better than everyone else.\\nI would go back and forth between gloating because I was better\\nthan them and complaining because they weren’ t as good as me.\\nAnd for whatever reason, it never occurred to me I was the one\\nwho hired and trained them. Who was I kidding?  The reality was\\ntwofold: First, I didn’ t have the skills to train or lead a team\\nproperly . Second, I was too poor , and then (when I had a little\\nmoney) too cheap to hire anyone better . In other words, it was my\\nfault they sucked. Oops.\\n \\nThe more I tried to outcompete my employees, the more distracted\\nI became, and the worse my business got. Sure, at the time, maybe\\nI could do anything  better than any  of my employees. But… I\\ncouldn’ t do  everything  better than all  my employees. And when I\\nfinally realized this, I started adopting better beliefs about talent:\\n \\n‘If you want it done right, get someone to spend all their time\\ndoing it.’\\n \\n‘If I can do it, someone else can do it better .’\\n \\n‘Everyone is r eplaceable, especially me.’\\n \\nThese new beliefs about talent not only made a much healthier\\nculture in my businesses but also came with very profitable side\\nef fects. T rusting my employees to succeed made my  time and\\nattention far  more valuable. If somebody else can do it, why would\\nI? If somebody else could train them, why would I? If I could learn\\nother stuf f to grow the business while my team held the fort down,\\nit makes way  more sense to do that. So let’ s do that.\\n \\nHow T o Get Employee Leads: The Internal Cor e Four\\n \\nRemember the core four? W ell, they work for getting employees\\ntoo. Imagine that. By changing the frame from “letting potential\\ncustomers know about your stuf f” to “letting potential employees\\nknow about your stuf f” it immediately  turns into something you\\nalready know how to do. But some people also have the opposite\\nproblem–they already know how to get employees just fine but still\\nstruggle to get customers. Employees ar e just other people you let\\nknow about your stuff. So you do the same thing!\\n \\n \\nLine up the actions to get employees with the actions to get\\ncustomers. It’ s the same stuff!\\n \\nCustomers → Employees\\n \\nW arm Outreach→Asking Y our Network\\nCold Outreach→ Recruiting\\nPost Content→Posting Job Openings\\nPaid Ads→Promoting Job Postings\\n \\nCustomer Referrals→Employee Referrals\\nAf filiates→ Associations, Guilds, Listservs etc.\\nAgencies→ Staf fing firms etc.\\nEmployees→Employees (unchanged)\\n \\nThe ways you get employee leads and their lead getters have\\nequivalents to the ways you get customer leads and their  lead\\ngetters. So when you need to get new talent, you just advertise to\\nget it. And when you need more, you do more. And like creating a\\nreliable process to get customers, you can also create a reliable\\nprocess of getting employees. And you’ll need both  to scale.\\n \\n \\nHow T o Get Employees T o Get Y ou Leads\\n \\nNow you hire someone who costs you money every month. Great.\\nLet’ s make sure you make it back, and some  ASAP .\\n \\nNote–some people looking for work will already know how to get\\nleads. Those people are awesome. Y ou can also count on them to\\ncost more. And if you’re starting out, you may not be able to af ford\\nthem. So, your next best option is to train them. Thankfully , you\\nhave an entire book of lead-getting at your fingertips. So the next\\nstep is training your employees on how you  do those lead-getting\\nactivities. I think about and actually approach training with this\\n3Ds mental model: document, demonstrate, duplicate.  Here’ s how\\nit works.\\n \\nStep One - Document .  Y ou make a checklist .  Y ou already know\\nhow to do the thing. Now you just need to write down the steps\\nexactly as you do it. Y ou can also have other trusted observers\\nwatch you and document what you do. Bonus points if you record\\nyourself doing the thing multiple ways and in multiple shifts. This\\nway , you can watch yourself as an observer rather than breaking\\nyour flow by pausing to take notes while you go. Once you’ve got\\neverything put into the checklist, bust it out on your next work\\nblock and only  follow those steps. Can you do an A+ job only\\nfollowing your  directions exactly ? If you can, you have the first\\ndraft  of your checklist for the job.\\n \\nStep T wo - Demonstrate : Y ou do it in fr ont of them .  Just like your\\nparents taught you how to tie your shoes. Y ou sit down and walk\\nthem through the checklist step by step. This may take a while\\ndepending on how many steps it takes to complete the thing. If\\nthey stop you, or slow you down to understand something, adjust\\nyour checklist for that. Now you have the second draft  ready for\\nthem to try .\\n \\nStep Thr ee - Duplicate : They do it in fr ont of you . Now it’ s their\\nturn. They follow the same checklist you followed. Except this\\ntime, they’re the one doing, and you’re the one observing. W e just\\nwant them to duplicate  what we did. So if the checklist is right, the\\noutcome will be the same. And if the checklist is of f–you’ll find\\nout fast! Fix your checklist until it’ s right. Then, have them follow\\nit until they get it right. And once they nail it , you now have a\\nbonafide lead-getter on your payroll. Congratulations!\\n \\n \\nAfter you train your first few employees this way , you’ll have\\nworked out the kinks for that job and it’ s pretty smooth sailing\\nfrom there. At least the training part anyways. Think about it this\\nway , if you vanished tomorrow , could a stranger get the results you\\nget if they only followed your checklist? That’ s the level of clarity\\nto shoot for .\\n \\nSome helpful notes on training:\\n \\nA helpful way to look at this training style is: If they get it wr ong\\nor get confused then we got it wr ong or made it confusing.  If we\\nhave to explain what a step means then the step is too\\ncomplicated. Or , more likely , we tried to put multiple steps into\\none.\\n \\nIf they only appear to “get it” after a longish explanation or\\nmultiple demonstrations then, again, we’ve got some work to do.\\nBusiness owners that ignore this run into chronic training\\nproblems. And, word to the wise, you can probably force an\\ninferior checklist to work, but this turns into a nightmar e  when\\nsomebody else takes over your training for you.\\n \\nThere is a dif ference between competence and performance. In\\nother words, they can know exactly what to do and not be that\\ngood at it yet . If that’ s the case, then your instructions are fine\\nand they just need practice.  Using an analogy from the fitness\\nworld–think “slow then smooth then fast.” Y ou don’ t need to\\nchange anything, they just need more reps.\\n \\nFocus on your employee’ s ability to follow dir ections mor e than\\nwhether they get the right r esult.  This is super important because\\nif you train your employees to follow directions then… they will\\nfollow directions. And, if they follow directions and get the\\nwrong result… then you know it’ s the dir ections . That’ s good.\\nY ou have a lot more control over that.\\n \\nEverytime they do a step successfully– let them know they did it\\nright . And if they respond to praise, praise them! And if they\\ngoof, that’ s OK too. That’ s what training is for . Don’ t take over\\nfor them when they mess up–simply pause, take a step back, and\\nlet them try it again. Fast feedback cycles to get people to learn\\nfaster .\\n \\nIf they follow your directions exactly  and get the wrong result–\\nstill praise them for following the directions. Praise them, then\\nmake the corrections to your checklist on the spot.\\n \\nA void punishment or penalties of any type for doing stuf f wrong\\nduring training. As a rule of thumb–reward the good stuf f you\\nwant them to do more of and they\\'ll do more of it. Learning a\\nnew skill is punishing enough, we don\\'t need to add to it.\\n \\nIt’ s hard to fix multiple things when you\\'ve never done\\nsomething befor e . Give feedback one step at a time. Give one\\npiece of feedback at a time. Practice until they get it right. Then,\\nmove to the next step.\\n \\nWhenever there is a major dip from normal performance, retrain\\nthe team. They stopped doing an important step in the process\\n(often because they didn’ t know it was important). Once you\\nfigure out the step, reward people for following it going forward.\\n \\n \\nHow to Calculate Returns Fr om Lead-Getting Employees\\n \\nExcluding the cost of running paid ads,  the cost of advertising\\n(outreach, content, etc.) with employees is almost entirely based on\\nthe amount of money you pay them to do it. W e simplify this by\\njust comparing how much money we spend on payroll to how\\nmuch money the engaged leads they get bring in:\\n \\n●    T otal Payroll / T otal Engaged Leads = Cost per engaged lead.\\n \\n○    Ex: $100,000 / 1000 leads = $100 per engaged lead\\n \\n●    If one out of ten of the engaged leads become customers then\\nour CAC is $1000\\n \\n○    ($100 per engaged lead) x (10 engaged leads per\\ncustomer) = $1000 CAC\\n \\n●    If each customer has an L TGP of $4000 then you have an\\nL TGP : CAC of 4:1\\n \\n○    ($4000 L TGP) / ($1000 CAC) = 4:1\\n \\nFor example: at the time of this writing, I get about 30,000\\nengaged leads per month at Acquistion.com. I run no paid ads, and\\ndo no outreach. But the team responsible for creating the content\\nthat generates that interest is about $100,000 per month. This\\nmeans, it costs me roughly $3.33 per engaged lead ($100,000 /\\n30,000 leads) in payroll to generate them. W e make much more\\nthan $3.33 per lead, so we’re profitable. Y ou can apply the same\\nmath to whatever advertising method you use.\\n \\n \\nHow T o Know Which Employees to Focus On T o Maximize\\nReturns\\n \\nLike we learned in Run Paid Ads Part II–if your cost to get a\\ncustomer is within 3x industry average then you’re doing good\\nenough . From there, you focus on bumping up your L TGP .\\n \\nIf your CAC is more than 3x industry average then you have a\\nsales problem or an advertising problem. W e diagnose this with a\\nsingle question:\\n \\nDo my engaged leads have the pr oblem I solve and the money to\\nspend?\\n \\nIf no, then they’re not qualified–that’ s an advertising problem.\\n \\nIf yes, then they’re qualified and:\\n \\nThey’re buying but you don’ t have enough of them–\\nadvertising problem.\\n \\nThey’re qualified but not buying–sales problem.\\n \\nDon’ t fire your sales guy if you’ve got advertising problems. And\\nequally , don’ t fire your advertising employees if you’ve got a sales\\nproblem. That little question can help you identify which\\nemployees to focus on.\\n \\nBut fundamentally , you just need to figure out all your  costs of\\ngetting a customer put together . And as long as they’re at least one-\\nthird of the profit you make over the lifetime, you’re in good\\nshape.\\n \\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe goal of this chapter was to shift your perspective . It\\'s your job\\nto advertise and sell the vision of your company . Y ou advertise it\\npublicly and  privately to employees and  customers alike. That’ s\\nthe job. And once you get good at it, you become unstoppable.\\n \\nI say this because I believe anyone can be taught to do \"ground\\nlevel\" jobs for any business– advertising or otherwise. So who you\\npick is not as important as how you train the ones you do.\\n \\nLike I\\'ve said throughout the book and will say again here–it\\ndoesn\\'t take a genius to advertise. I\\'d even say it hurts. W e’ve got\\nplenty more iron-wills than brainiacs anyways. Remember , this\\nisn’ t about brains, it\\'s about guts. And although some people might\\nbe born geniuses, nobody  is born with an iron will (after all, we all\\ncome out crybabies). All this to say having guts is a skill.  And that\\nmeans anyone  can have the guts if they learn how .  So if you have\\nan iron-will, and as an entrepreneur you probably do, it won’ t take\\nlong for you to figure out that you got it from your life\\nexperiences. Y ou can pass those experiences on as lessons to\\nanyone who cares enough to listen. Then, they can stand on your\\nshoulders and have a better chance at succeeding in life.\\n \\nAnd - you can’ t really know anything anyway until you train them\\nwell and give them a fighting chance to succeed out in the field.\\nPlus, for low level jobs, you\\'ll never have a shortage of labor . Get\\npicky when you have to make massive investments in hyper -\\nspecific-multiple-six-figure-C-suite employees. Aka - ‘fancy\\nemployees.’\\n \\nI find at this current stage, it\\'s actually a better use of time, to hire\\nand train anyone willing . Then, when  you find winners, and with\\nthis method you will: treat them well, don’ t burn them out, and\\ngive them what they deserve.\\n \\nIn the land of overflowing leads, you’ll need allies. Employees are\\namong the most powerful of these allies. W e talked about: how\\nthey make you wealthy , how they work, how getting them works,\\nhow to get them, how to get them getting you leads, how to keep\\nthem getting you leads, and how to know you’re doing a good job.\\nAnd once you’ve built a system for getting people who get you\\nleads (doing the core four on your behalf), you just need to do\\nmore.\\n \\n \\n \\nThe Next Lead Getter…\\n \\nThe next stop on our advertising journey leads us to agencies. Y es,\\nyou can pay people to shortcut your path. I have paid zillions of\\ndollars to agencies and I believe I’ve finally *cracked* the code on\\nhow to create a win for all parties. For us, so we’re not dependent\\non them forever . For them, so they can make more profit and\\nprovide more value to their customers. They’ve been key to many\\nbreakthroughs I’ve had, so you won’ t want to skip this next one…\\n \\n \\n\\n# 3  A g e n c i e s\\n“Everything is for sale”\\n \\n \\nSummer 2016.\\n \\nI wasn’ t a tech guy . I was a fitness guy who had learned a few\\nmarketing and sales tricks building my gyms. But now I had five,\\nand was launching my sixth. It was time to level up. Facebook had\\njust released some new features: retar geting, interest groups,\\npixels, etc. And I didn’ t understand any of it. I bought a few\\ncourses but ended up more confused than when I started.\\n \\nI asked a few friends if they knew anyone who could help. I got\\ntwo referrals. Both were agencies. I was scared. I had never used\\none before. I had only ever heard horror stories about advertising\\nagencies. Mostly that they cost a ton and never work. But then I\\nrealized that even if they did work, I’d need  them forever . They’d\\nhave my business by the balls! It turns out my expectations weren’ t\\nfar of f. They of fered to run my ads alright, for an arm and a leg.\\nMoney I couldn’ t justify spending with my low mar gins. But, then\\nagain, my advertising costs were killing me. And at this rate, in a\\nfew months, I wouldn’ t be able to keep my doors open. Stressful.\\n \\nI refused the first agency because I couldn’ t af ford it at the time.\\nThe second call started going the same way . I began to panic. How\\nam I gonna fix this?  In what felt like a last ditch ef fort to stay in\\nbusiness, I asked the second agency owner for what I r eally\\nwanted…\\n \\n“Can you just show me in a few hours how you would run ads on\\nmy account?”\\n \\n“No.” He fired back. “My time’ s not for sale.”\\n \\nW orried but still hopeful… “What sort of arrangement could we\\ncome to?”\\n \\nHe thought for a moment. Then his eyebrow shot up and a smirk\\nappeared. “Fine. $750 an hour .” Gulp . His intimidation tactic\\nworked. But at least I knew his time was for sale... so I wanted to\\nfind out more.\\n \\n“And for $750 per hour you will sit down with me  and show me\\nhow you  would run my ads?”\\n \\n“Y es.”\\n \\n“And, I’d be the one doing everything? Like, you’ll walk me\\nthrough what to do and look over my shoulder as I do it, then\\nyou’ll explain why you do it that way?”\\n \\n“Y ea”\\n \\n“And you’re confident you can make my ads more profitable? …\\nand show me the more advanced stuf f too, right?”\\n \\n“Y ea. I mean. If you wanna pay me $750 an hour , we can do\\nwhatever you want. It’ s your money” He said, half laughing. It\\nsounded more like It’ s your funeral.\\n \\nI paused. “Alright. I’ll do it. W e’ll meet one hour a week. Y ou give\\nme homework and I’ll study between calls. Fair enough?”\\n \\n“W orks for me. But you gotta pay for the first four hours up front”\\n \\nSo that’ s what I did. I placed a three thousand dollar bet on this\\nguy’ s word that he knew what he was doing. Y ikes . But, every\\nweek thereafter , I showed up. And like a good student, I came with\\nnotes and questions ready . I also recorded and rewatched every call\\nbecause I didn’ t want to miss anything.\\n \\nThe first two calls, he took the wheel and I watched. Calls three\\nand four , he put me in the driver ’ s seat. By calls five and six, it\\nclicked. I got how he made decisions and what data he tracked. At\\nseven and eight, I realized I didn’ t need his help anymore. I had\\nlearned how to run paid ads, at least on Facebook, like a pro. And,\\nif I had to make a guess, it was because I learned it…from a pro.\\n \\nIn this chapter , we explore a not-so-obvious-but-much-better -way\\nto use agencies to get more leads. Let’ s get crankin’.\\n \\n \\nHow Agencies W ant Y ou T o Think They W ork\\n \\nAdvertising agencies are lead-getting service businesses. Y ou pay\\nthem to run paid ads, do outreach, or package and distribute\\ncontent.\\n \\nFor example, let’ s say you want to post free video content. But,\\nyou know nothing about making video content or how to distribute\\nit. Y ou’d need to learn how to pick video topics, record videos, edit\\nvideos, make thumbnail images, and write headlines. Or , you’d\\nneed to hire the people who do. Enter the agency . They say they’ve\\nhired and trained people to do that stuf f already . So they promise\\nfaster , better , and more cost-ef ficient results than you could get on\\nyour own. And as soon as I had enough money , it felt compelling\\nenough.\\n \\nAfter my first experience with an agency , that I mentioned earlier\\nand went quite well, I decided to use more. But my experience\\nwith the next ten plus agencies was differ ent  because I used them\\n‘the right way .’ Each went something like this:\\n \\nStep 1: They got me excited about all the new leads they would\\nbring.\\n \\nStep 2: I’d go through an onboarding process that felt valuable\\n(and sometimes was). \\n \\nStep 3: They assigned their “best” senior rep to my account. \\n \\nStep 4: I saw some results.\\n \\nStep 5: They moved my senior rep to the newest customer ...\\n \\nStep 6: A junior rep starts managing my account. My results\\nsuf fered.\\n \\nStep 7: I complained.\\n \\nStep 8: The senior rep would come back once in a while to make\\nme feel better .\\n \\nStep 9: Results still suf fered. And I’d eventually cancel.\\n \\nStep 10: I’d search for another agency and repeat the cycle of\\ninsanity .\\n \\nStep 1 1: For the zillionth time –Start wondering why I wasn’ t\\ngetting results like the first time.\\n \\n \\nT o be clear , like the introduction to this chapter shows, agencies\\ncan  play a valuable role in business growth. But not the way they\\nwant you to. I don\\'t want anyone else falling into the same trap. In\\nfact, I hope all the money I wasted goes towards paying down your\\nignorance tax too. So keep reading.\\n \\nIt’ s frankly ridiculous that it took me so many years to figure out\\nthat I actually used an agency the right  way…the first  time! But\\nnow , after playing their game so many times, I feel I cracked the\\n“how to use an agency” code. And it doesn’ t come from playing\\ntheir game at all . It comes from playing a dif ferent one. And this\\nchapter breaks it all down in three steps:\\n \\n1 . Hiring an agency versus doing it yourself\\n \\n2 . How I use agencies now . And how you can, too.\\n \\n3 . How to pick the right agency\\n \\n \\nHiring An Agency V ersus Doing It Y ourself\\n \\nFirst, let’ s get this out of the way . Good agencies cost money . So if\\nyou have no money , then agencies are out of the question. Y ou’ve\\ngotta learn through trial and error . And that’ s no big deal. W e all\\nstart that way . But if you do have some money , I suggest using\\nagencies for two things: learning new methods and learning new\\nplatforms.\\n \\nIf I want to learn new ways to do content, outreach, or paid ads,\\nthen I hire agencies of fering new ways to do them. They’ve\\nalready made the big mistakes. So instead of wasting time figuring\\nit out myself, I skip straight to the ‘make money’ part. I like the\\n‘make money’ part.\\n \\nI also use agencies when I want to start advertising on a platform I\\ndon\\'t understand. I make money faster because they do the early\\nsetup and maintenance for me and because I get them to teach me\\nhow to do it.\\n \\nHiring an agency is all about investing in important skills you can’ t\\nreally learn anywhere else. That is, unless you go through all  the\\ntrial and error to learn it yourself. And if you did, you lose the\\ntime, and attention you could have used to learn the other\\nimportant stuf f that scales your business. And scaling your\\nbusiness is the whole point.\\n \\nAction Step: As soon as you have enough money for a good\\nagency , start poking around. If you follow the rest of the steps in\\nthis chapter , you’ll make it all back… and then some.\\n \\n \\nHow I Use Agencies Now . And How Y ou Can T oo.\\n \\nI’ve become a little more sophisticated than the story I told at the\\nbeginning. Here’ s how I use agencies now . Rather than believe the\\nlie that “I’ll never have to learn this stuf f because they can do it,” I\\nstart every agency relationship with a purpose and a deadline to\\nfulfill it. I open by saying:\\n \\n“I want to do what you do in my business, but I don’ t know how .\\nI’d like to work with you for 6 months so I can learn how you do it.\\nPlus, I’ll pay extra for you to br eak down why you make the\\ndecisions you do and the steps you take to make them. Then, after I\\nget a good idea of how it all works, I’ll start training my team on\\nit. And once they can do it well enough, I’d like to change to a\\nlower cost consulting arrangement. This way , you can still help us\\nif we run into pr oblems. Ar e you opposed to this?”\\n \\nIn my experience, most agencies are not  opposed to this. And if it\\ndoesn\\'t work for them, that’ s perfectly fine. Just move on to the\\nnext agency . But, before you start kicking everyone to the curb, be\\nwilling to negotiate. At some price, it’ s worth it for both of you.\\nV iva capitalism!\\n \\nThis is how I use agencies now . Like when I wanted to learn\\nY ouT ube, I actually hired two  agencies. The first, I hired to keep\\nme committed to making videos while they did some legwork on\\nthe platform itself. The second I hired (at 4x the price) to really\\nteach us the in-depth ideas behind making the best content\\npossible. And once our videos beat their videos, we dropped down\\nto consulting only .\\n \\nI’ve used this method again and again. I hire one “good enough”\\nagency to learn the ropes of a new platform. Then, I hire a more\\nelite agency to learn how to maximize it– and I cannot r ecommend\\nthis strategy enough.\\n \\nIf you are upfront about your intentions and the agency agrees, you\\nget the best of both worlds. Y ou get better short-term results\\nbecause they (probably) know more than you. And, you get better\\nlong-term results because you learn how to do it yourself or your\\nteam learns to do it for you. Y ou also spend the maximum amount\\nof time with their best r eps .\\n \\nRemember , you only get a fraction  of the agency’ s attention, so\\nresults get worse whenever they get new clients. Meanwhile, your\\nteam gets better and better because they stay focused on you full-\\ntime. So compare your team’ s results to the agency’ s until you beat\\nthem. Then, cancel the relationship and put the money into scaling\\neverything you just learned.\\n \\nAction Step: When you find an agency to work with (next step)\\nset terms with them and deadlines for yourself. Use the template\\nabove as your guide. And feel OK with negotiating a bit to make it\\nwork.\\n \\n \\n \\nHow to Pick The Right Agency\\n \\n \\nAfter working with tons of bad agencies, and a handful of good\\nones, I created a list of what all the good ones had in common.\\nNow it isn’ t the last word on what makes a good agency , but it is\\nuseful stuf f that’ s worked for me.\\n \\nHere’ s what I look for:\\n \\n1)  Somebody I know got good results working with them. If you\\nonly know about an agency from their paid ads or cold\\noutreach… they probably aren’ t as good as the ones who rely\\nsolely on word of mouth (and the best ones do).\\n \\n2)  Prominent companies got good results working with them. I may\\nnot know the companies personally , but if I recognize them, it’ s\\na good sign.\\n \\n3)  A waiting list. When demand for a service exceeds the supply ,\\nthey are probably pretty good.\\n \\n4)  A clear sales process that makes a point to set realistic\\nexpectations. No funny business. \\n \\n5)  No short term hacks. They keep the talk on long term strategy .\\nThey also give clear timelines for setup, scaling, and results.\\n \\n6)  They tell me exactly what they need from me, when they need it,\\nand how they use it.\\n \\n7)  They  suggest a regular schedule of  meetings and of fer several\\nways to update me on their progress.\\n \\n8)  They give updates in simple terms and have clear ways to track\\nso I know how costs compare with results.\\n \\n9)  They make a good of fer:\\n \\na . Dream outcome : is what they promise what I want?\\n \\nb . Perceived likelihood of achievement : how many other\\npeople like me have they gotten there?\\n \\nc . T ime delay : how long will it take?\\n \\nd . Ef fort and sacrifice : what do they require me to do when\\nworking with them? What will I have to give up? Can I\\nstick with those for a long time?\\n \\n10)       They are expensive. All good agencies are expensive… but\\nnot all expensive agencies are good. So talk with as many as it\\ntakes. And use this list as a guide to find the good ones.\\n \\n…if an agency checks those boxes, they’re worth considering.\\n \\n \\nAction step: Even if an agency agrees to your terms, talk with a\\nfew more before you make a decision. Compare them using the\\nchecklist above, and then pick the best one for you.\\n \\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nEven though this isn’ t the “traditional” agency model, both\\nbusinesses benefit. They get a customer they otherwise wouldn\\'t\\nhave. And we get a money-making skill for life. In the story at the\\nbeginning of the chapter - it cost me eight hours and $6000 to learn\\na skill that’ s  made me millions . Does that seem worth it to you? It\\nbetter .\\n \\nAnd to make this agency method work at scale, you have to count\\non a good amount of time where you pay the agency and your team\\nto do the same stuff . Y ou’ve gotta give yourself some breathing\\nroom to get results from the agency , learn what they do, and  train\\nyour team on it... all at once. Y es, it costs a lot of money . And yes,\\nit’ s totally worth it when you get it right.\\n \\nAnd get it right you can. After agencies put a low level employee\\non my account for the millionth time, it finally clicked. This can’ t\\nbe that  hard.  At first, it took about a year to get my team better\\nthan an agency . As I got better , it went down to ten months, then\\neight. And now , I’ve got it down. I can get my team as good or\\nbetter than the agency in less than six months or less. And every\\ntime I want to learn a new method or platform, I repeat the process.\\n \\nThe better you get, the cheaper it becomes, and the more money\\nyou make. Funny , that sounds a lot like advertising.\\n \\n \\nNext Steps:\\n \\n1)  Decide if using an agency makes sense for you right now .\\n \\n2)  T alk to a lot of agencies to get a feel for the market. Don’ t be\\ncheap. \\n \\n3)  Use the agreement framework I outlined.\\n \\n4)  Set a clear deadline to force you (and your team) to learn the\\nskills.\\n \\n5)  Use both teams until yours beats theirs regularly .\\n \\n6)  Switch to discounted consulting until you feel like you’re\\nteaching them instead of them teaching you…then cut ‘em\\nloose.\\n \\n \\nNow that we know how to profit from the high risk world of\\nagencies, we explore the lead-getter that’ s made me the most\\nmoney . W e recruit an army of businesses who can get us even\\nmore leads - affiliates .\\n \\n \\n\\n# 4  A f f i l i a t e s  a n d  P a r t n e r s\\n“Nothing makes friends like money”\\n \\n \\nDecember 1st, 2018\\n \\nI had no idea how the Prestige Labs launch would go. I had no idea\\nif our clients would like it. I had no idea if the technology we built\\nwould work. I had no idea if payouts would happen on time. I had\\nno idea if our warehouse would mess up orders.\\n \\nBut I did know over a year of preparation went into this launch.\\nW e put everything we had into creating a top-tier product. W e\\nspent over $1,000,000 custom-building af filiate software and\\ntraining. And - we bought $3,000,000 in inventory for sales that\\nmay never happen. It took every business skill I had to make\\nPrestige Labs real. And, in just a few hours, we would roll it out to\\nour gym owner af filiates. I felt like a kid on Christmas Eve. And if\\nit didn’ t work, it wouldn’ t be for lack of effort.\\n \\n \\n \\nLaunch day…\\n \\nI finished the two-hour presentation soaked in sweat. It’ s done .\\n \\nI ‘sold’ the opportunity to sell my supplement line at their gyms. I\\nwould train  the new af filiates to promote Prestige Labs at their\\ngyms. So, for this to work, they would have to go through the\\ntraining and  use it. But, if they did, everyone would profit. I had no\\nidea if it would work.\\n \\nThr ee weeks later…\\n \\nW e made $150,000 in total  sales. Meanwhile, $3,000,000 worth of\\nproduct sat in an air -conditioned warehouse… It didn’ t work .\\n \\nAt this rate, including operating costs and af filiate payouts, it\\nwould take five years to  br eak even . Even if we could stick it out,\\nour premium product would expire well before then. W e were all\\nbut screwed. I felt miserable. It was terrible. Who am I to think we\\nwould sell all that stuff? I just wasted MILLIONS. How could I be\\nso stupid?\\n \\nBut…on the fourth week…something wild happened…\\n \\nBOOM! $100,000 on Monday .\\n \\nBOOM! $1 10,000 on T uesday\\n \\nBOOM! $92,000 on W ednesday .\\n \\nW e did over $450,000 in sales the fourth week alone . The trend\\ncontinued. $429,000…$383,000…$41 1,000…$452,000. W e\\naveraged more than 300 orders per day across 400+ active\\naf filiates. Orders just kept coming in. Check out the snapshot of\\nour internal report below . It shows, from left to right, revenue by\\nweek . I couldn’ t believe the results. Sometimes, I still can’ t.\\n \\n \\nThe best part is, I didn’ t advertise or sell any of the pr oducts at all.\\nNo paid ads. No sales team. Nothing. The af filiates did everything–\\nand the af filiate machine I built still prints money to this day . So if\\nthat sounds like something you’re interested in, hang tight, because\\nI’m gonna show you exactly how I built it.\\n \\n \\nHow Affiliates W ork\\n \\n \\nAn affiliate  is a lead-getter . They are an independent business that\\ntells their audience to buy your  stuf f. Af filiates seem like referrals\\non the outside, but are much dif ferent under the hood. First, they\\nhave their own businesses and do their own advertising. Second,\\nthey agree to of fer your  stuf f to their  engaged leads in exchange\\nfor money , free stuf f, or both.\\n \\nNow , you get af filiates by advertising and then making them of fers\\njust like you would customers. But, af filiates demand a unique type\\nof of fer . Instead of of fering your product, you of fer a fast, simple,\\nand easy way to make commissions promoting it. And that can\\nmean literally millions of engaged leads to your business. So this\\nmakes af filiates one of the highest-leverage lead-getters out there.\\n \\n \\nWhy Y ou W ant An Affiliate Army\\n \\nEach af filiate you get adds another str eam  of leads and customers.\\nSo recruiting, activating, then integrating with an army of af filiates\\ncauses crazy scaling, fast. That\\'s good. W e want that.\\n \\nCompare these two scenarios:\\n \\n \\nScenario #1:  Y ou sell ten customers  per month worth $10,000\\neach. Y our business caps at $100,000 per month. In twelve months\\nyou’ve made 1.2 million. Assuming no other advertising, your\\nbusiness plateaus . Low-Leverage.\\n \\n \\nScenario #2:  For the same ef fort, you sell ten affiliates  per month.\\nEach month, those af filiates bring you one  of those $10,000\\ncustomers. Now , every single month you add an extra  $100,000 in\\nrevenue. In twelve months you’ve made 7.8 million . And it grows\\nevery month ther eafter . Same work, more money .  High-Leverage.\\n \\nLet’ s use ALAN, my software company I grew with af filiates, to\\nshow how this works in the real world:\\n \\nALAN grew with three levels of af filiates:\\n \\n1)  Agency super -af filiates who brought agency leads\\n \\n2)  Agencies who brought local business leads\\n \\n3)  Local businesses who brought end consumer leads \\n \\nOne super -af filiate added ten agencies per month. The ten agencies\\nbrought in a combined fifty or so local businesses per month.\\nThose local businesses brought in a combined 2500 leads per\\nmonth. ALAN worked those leads for about $5 a pop. A cool\\n$12,500 per month .\\n \\nBut it didn’ t stop there. Each super -af filiate brought in mor e\\nagencies who brought in mor e  local businesses who brought mor e\\nleads every month after that. So every super -af filiate we signed on\\nbrought in $12,500 the first month, $25,000 the second, $37,500\\nthe third, and so on. W ith only a few agency super -af filiates, we\\nscaled to $1,700,000 per month within six months of launching.\\nThat’ s  why you want an af filiate army . So let’ s build one.\\n \\nHow T o Build An Affiliate Army in Six Steps\\n \\nAf filiates are among the most advanced ways to get engaged leads.\\nFirst, you have to convince them to advertise someone else\\'s stuf f.\\nSecond, you have to convince them to advertise your  stuf f. Third,\\nyou have to keep them advertising  to make them a long-term lead\\nsource. It seems like a lot. And it is. But, I have good news…\\n \\nI’ve built two companies with af filiates: ALAN and Prestige Labs.\\nT ogether , they have done more than $75,000,000 in revenue from\\nover 5000+ af filiates. And the af filiate strategies I share worked for\\nme. So they can work for you. I’ll break down each step.\\n \\nStep 1 : Find Y our Ideal Af filiates\\n \\nStep 2 : Make Them an Of fer \\n \\nStep 3 : Qualify Them\\n \\nStep 4 : Figure Out What T o Pay Them\\n \\nStep 5 : Get Them Advertising\\n \\nStep 6 : Keep Them Advertising\\n \\nThat’ s it. Let’ s dive in.\\n \\n \\nStep 1: Find Y our Ideal Affiliate\\n \\nThe ideal af filiate has a business with a warm audience full of\\npeople like your customers. Start making a list of those businesses.\\nIf none come to mind, answer these questions about your best\\ncustomers:\\n \\nWhat do they buy? → Who pr ovides that stuff?\\n \\nWher e do they go? → What businesses ar e in those surr ounding\\nar eas?\\n \\nWhat do they like to do? → Who pr ovides those services?\\n \\nIf direct to consumer – the employers of your consumers could\\nmake great af filiates:\\n \\nWhat types of businesses do they work for? What kinds of jobs do\\nthey have?\\n \\nIn a nutshell…  Who’ s got my leads!?\\n \\nFor example, when I started ALAN, agency owners were my ideal\\naf filiate. So I made a list of 200 products and services for agencies\\nand the businesses that delivered them. After a little bit of work I\\nrealized they fit pretty neatly into categories: softwar es, pr oducts,\\nequipment, services, gr oups they belong to, and events they\\nattended . Every time I create a new af filiate “hit list” I start with\\nthese categories. Note: If you find a business that falls into\\nmultiple categories, there’ s a high chance they’ve got lots of good\\nleads for you and that they’d make a great af filiate.\\n \\nNow that I knew the businesses that had my leads I knew exactly\\nwhere to put my advertising ef forts. It wasn’ t fancy , so don’ t\\noverthink it.\\n \\nAction Step : Make a sheet with each of these questions and\\ncategories. Search online to fill it in. If you struggle, call up your\\ncustomers and ask them! End result : Create a lead list of your\\nhighest potential af filiates.\\n \\n \\nStep 2: Make Them An Offer\\n \\nW e make the af filiate-of fer and advertise it the same way we\\nwould any other of fer . W e call out our audience, show our value\\nelements, and then call them to action. But af filiates will only sign\\nup with us if we give them a strong reason. Thankfully , it’ s pretty\\nsimple. Since af filiates are businesses, or start a business by\\nsigning up, you offer them a new way to make money . W e’ll start\\nwith the callout.\\n \\nCall out:\\n \\nCall outs for potential af filiates often include:\\n \\nThe af filiate business owners themselves - A TTENTION  SP A\\nOWNERS\\n \\nThe af filiate’ s customers - Do you work with busy pr ofessionals\\nwho spend all day in meetings?  \\n \\nResults the af filiate businesses promise - T o the her oes who heal\\nthe str ess of others…\\n \\nProducts and services the af filiates deliver - If you sell lotions or\\nscented oils this is for you…\\n \\nT o our own customers - Do you know anyone who owns a spa?\\n \\nNow that we can grab a potential af filiate’ s attention - let’ s make it\\nworth their while…\\n \\n \\nElements Of V alue\\n \\nThere’ s an unlimited number of ways to show value, but all money\\nmaking of fers follow a similar structure. That’ s good news, we\\ndon\\'t need to reinvent the wheel. Most af filiate money making\\nof fers show value like this:\\n \\nMake mor e money fr om your curr ent customers and get mor e leads\\nthan your curr ent offer ( dr eam outcome )…with a high chance of\\nworking since your customers alr eady want the pr oduct ( per ceived\\nlikelihood of achievement )...without needing to build, deliver , or\\npr ovide customer support for the pr oduct yourself ( effort and\\nsacrifice )...so you can start selling it tomorr ow ( time delay ).\\n \\nAction Step:  Explore the dif ferent value elements and fill in the\\nblanks. I won\\'t go deeper on this since we’ve covered it already .\\nY ou simply need to make affiliates  the customer you’re advertising\\nto.\\n \\nNow that we’ve got the potential af filiate interested in our of fer ,\\nlet’ s qualify them.\\n \\n \\nStep 3: Qualify Them\\n \\nPotential af filiates become actual af filiates when they understand\\nand agree to your terms. And - just like customers - we want to get\\nthem their first win as fast as possible. So we setup our terms to\\nforce them to win as fast as possible.\\n \\nI do that by getting them to invest. I prefer they invest their time,\\ntheir money , and  in the product itself. Any can work. But, nine\\ntimes out of ten, if they pay , they’ll pay attention . Here are the two\\nways I get my af filiates invested and winning: make them a\\ncustomer , and make them an expert. Let’ s dive into each.\\n \\n \\nW ay #1: Make Them A Customer :  Make them buy and\\npreferably use the product to keep af filiate status. This is the\\nlowest barrier investment that’ s worked for me. I’ve found the\\nmore money an af filiate invests in your product, the more money\\nthey make. This should make sense. If they don’ t believe in your\\nstuf f enough to buy it, they probably shouldn’ t sell it. Y ou can tell\\nthem I said so.\\n \\n \\n \\nW ay #2: Make Them An Expert :  I make them pay for the\\nonboarding and training that certifies them as a product expert. If\\nyou have them buy a product to become an af filiate, you can have\\nthem use that as credit towards a certification. As in, the\\ncertification comes with  the products they bought. Now , aside from\\nactually making the af filiate useful, certifying them does two\\nthings. First, it covers some of the costs of advertising. Second, it\\nmeans I can af ford proper onboarding and training of every . single.\\naf filiate.\\n \\nHow much do I charge? I recommend 10-20% of what the\\naverage active af filiate makes in the first twelve months. So if your\\naverage af filiate makes $40,000 per year selling your stuf f, then\\nchar ge $4000-$8000 to onboard and train them. T oo low , and you\\nwon’ t get them invested. T oo high and you won’ t get enough\\naf filiates. I found 10-20% maximizes the number of people who\\nbecome active  af filiates. If you’re just getting started and have\\nphysical products then use the bulk purchasing strategy from the\\npro tip. Otherwise, you can use the strategy from the warm\\nreachout chapter and raise the minimum investment every 5 sign\\nups until you hit the sweet spot.\\n \\nAction Step : Make your af filiates customers, experts, or both (my\\nfavorite way).  If you don\\'t get enough people to start, lower the\\ncommitment. If you don\\'t get enough people to follow through,\\nraise it. \\n \\n \\nStep 4: Figur e Out What T o Pay Them\\n \\n \\nThe first biggest problem to solve with af filiates is getting them\\nbought in. But the second biggest problem is how to keep them\\nbought in.  And no matter how you slice it, keeping your af filiates\\nbought in depends on how you reward them for advertising your\\nstuf f. I prefer to reward people that do things I like with money and\\nfree stuf f, especially if they make me money first. So let’ s talk\\nabout that.\\n \\nWhen I figure out ways to pay af filiates I look at two basic things:\\n \\n1 . What they get paid for \\n \\n2 . How much they get paid\\n \\n \\n1. What  They Get Paid For \\n \\nBefore I do any af filiate payout money math I ask myself a simple\\nquestion. What exactly  do I want the af filiate to do? Once I figure\\nthat out, that  is what I pay them for . Then, more often than not,\\nhow much they get paid and how often they get paid nearly solve\\nthemselves. I pay af filiates for two basic things: new customers,\\nand repeat customers. Over time, if you track your metrics better ,\\nyou can pay them for steps befor e  someone becomes a customer .\\nLike for the lead magnets downloaded, appointments set, or\\nanything else you know reliably turns into sales for you.\\n \\n2. How Much  They Get Paid\\n \\nI suggest paying af filiates based on your maximum allowable cost\\nto acquire a customer (CAC).\\n \\nExample: choosing your maximum allowable CAC . Let’ s say we\\nsell a single-use product for $200 and it costs $40 to fulfill. This\\ngives us $160 to pay the af filiate and  run the business. If we want\\nan L TGP:CAC ratio of 3:1 then three parts goes to the business–\\n$120. And one part , $40,  goes to the af filiate. This means we will\\npay up to $40 for an af filiate to get a new customer .\\n \\nBut here’ s where things get interesting. I used to give away the\\nfarm (the whole CAC). I suppose I still do, but I’ve gotten pickier\\nabout who I give it to. Not all af filiates are created equal. So, I\\nsuggest having a three-tier  payout structure. Using the example\\nabove, with a $40 maximum allowable CAC, a three-tier payout\\nstructure might look something like this:\\n \\n●    T ier 1: 25% CAC = $10 Payout - Anyone who agrees  to my initial\\nterms qualifies.\\n \\n○    Example: They sign up and buy products or a certification.\\n \\n●    T ier 2: 50% CAC = $20 Payout  - Once they activate .\\n \\n○    Example: actually finishing the certification  they bought ,\\ndoing a specific number of posts and outreach, doing a\\nlaunch, etc.\\n \\n○    This gives them a nice reward (twice the pay) for activating.\\n \\n●    T ier 3: 100% CAC = $40 Payout - Once they sustain  a level of\\nperformance.\\n \\n○    Example: They maintain five customers per month on\\nsubscription.\\n \\nThis tiered method also has a hidden and very profitable side\\nef fect. The average  payout is much less than your maximum\\nallowable CAC. This means if we leave the maximum payouts for\\ntop af filiates, then we get to keep the “leftover” profit. W e can use\\nthe leftover money to run huge contests, advertise to get more\\naf filiates, incentivize rising stars, etc. Or , I suppose, we can just\\nplain pocket it.\\n \\nFor example, if 20% of sales come from tier 1, 20% from tier 2,\\nand 60% from tier 3, your blended payout is $30 instead of your\\nmaximum allowable CAC of $40. This means your L TGP : CAC\\nratio just improved from 3:1 to 4:1. And often, cutting marketing\\ncosts by 33% can translate into 10% to 20% more net profit at the\\nend of the year . A massive jump.\\n \\n \\nAction step: Figure out what you want to pay your af filiates for so\\nthat you can plan out how much to pay them, with what, and how\\noften.\\n \\n \\nStep 5: Get Them Advertising – Launch\\n \\nLike referrers, how much value af filiates get from you determines\\nhow much they advertise your stuf f. So, tr eat them like customers.\\nGive them something good, fast. And nothing does that for\\naf filiates like big launches and lots of cash.\\n \\nHere’ s how launches work:\\n \\nAf filiates advertise your lead magnet or core of fer to their audience\\nbefor e they can buy it . They post. They do warm outreach. They\\nrun paid ads. They may even do cold outreach. They do as much\\nadvertising as they can until the day of launch. When the product is\\navailable, they sell it to all the engaged leads they assembled.\\nSome sell one-on-one, some pitch to the whole group. And others\\nsimply make the product available.\\n \\nSo if you’re gonna do launches to activate your af filiates, which\\nyou should, you may as well do them right. I use the whisper -\\ntease-shout method. I can’ t remember where I first heard this, but\\nthe name stuck. Let’ s launch.\\n \\n \\nBefore we get launching, remember: good launches have the work\\ndone ahead of time.  So do all the work for them. Then, they can\\nplug and play . Let’ s break down each launch phase. And, I’ll give\\nan example of my book launch to drive each point home. Note: this\\nis how you launch anything, not just af filiates. I put it in the\\naf filiates section because I haven’ t found a better way to activate\\naf filiates than launches.\\n \\nWhisper : Think “Call Outs.”  Like an ad, the key to the whisper\\nphase is curiosity . Keep the product itself mysterious and hint at\\nhow big of a deal it is. Keep whispers short. And bonus points if\\nyou show behind the scenes of making your product.\\n \\nIf you have something in the works, you can start the whisper\\nphase a few years out. The further out you start whispering, the\\nbigger deal it becomes to your audience. W e start this early\\nbecause, the longer something appears to take, the more an\\naudience will value it. For example, all other things being equal, an\\naudience will value a product that took ten years to make more\\nthan one that took ten days. So - show your work .\\n \\nRemember: curiosity comes from wanting to know what happens\\nnext . So embed questions about the product in their minds. W e\\nneed to tell them about something they want to know more about,\\nthen say… not yet .\\n \\nFor example during the whisper phase of my book launch : I posted\\ncontent, reached out to friends, emailed my list, and told potential\\naf filiates about major updates to the book. I showed what draft I\\nwas on. I took pictures behind the scenes of me printing out drafts.\\nI showed the many versions of the frameworks I drew . I shared\\nvideos of myself editing the book early in the morning and late at\\nnight, etc…all of it made people who want leads  get curious and\\npay attention .\\n \\nAction Step : Start whispering every four to six weeks until you get\\nsixty days out. Then whisper every two to three weeks until you\\nget thirty days out. Then, start teasing…\\n \\n \\nT ease :  Think “Elements Of V alue.”  It’ s time to start satisfying all\\nthe curiosity you created during the whisper phase. Reveal your\\nproduct, make the date of the launch public, and start showing  the\\nelements of value. Use the What-Who-When Framework from the\\npaid ads chapter .\\n \\nFor example during my book launch, the tease phase : I was more\\nspecific and revealed more “hard” information about the book. I\\nstarted advertising how the book satisfied the dream outcome of\\nlimitless leads. Of doing less work, and getting it done faster than\\nthey could imagine. I also showed dozens of examples using the\\nbook to its potential.\\n \\nAction Step : Start teasing once per week until fourteen days out.\\nThen tease twice per week until three days out. Three days out, it’ s\\ntime to shout from the rooftops.\\n \\n \\nShout:  Think “Call to Action.”  Give specific actions for the\\naudience to take when the product launches. Now you start\\npounding the audience with bonuses, scarcity , ur gency , and\\nguarantees around being “the first ones.” Y ou shout to get as many\\npeople exposed to your of fer as you can.\\n \\nFor example during my book launch, the shout phase : I gave\\nspecific calls to action. Short, sweet, clear reminders to register for\\nthe book launch. I reminded everyone of the exclusive bonuses\\nonly for people who bought during the launch.\\n \\nAction Step : Shout at least twice a day starting three days out. On\\nthe day of, start shouting every few hours until two hours out. Then\\nshout every thirty minutes until you launch the product.\\n \\n \\nAction Step : Get your af filiates to launch. Set them up with\\neverything they need to do the whisper -tease-shout right. They do\\nthe advertising. Y ou get the engaged leads. Everyone  gets paid.\\n \\n \\nStep 6: Keep Them Advertising\\n \\nThe strategy we use to start  them advertising dif fers from the one\\nwe use to keep  them advertising. In an ideal world, you sell an\\naf filiate once and they send engaged leads for life. Integration gets\\nus there.\\n \\nI’ve got three ways you can integrate your product into their of fer .\\nI order these from easiest to hardest. First, you can get them to give\\naway your lead magnet  with every purchase of their stuf f. Second,\\nyou can get them to sell your lead magnet separately  to their\\naudience. Third, you can get them to directly sell your cor e offer .\\n \\n \\nThey give away your lead magnet for fr ee, which makes their cor e\\noffer mor e valuable for no extra cost. Then, you upsell your cor e\\noffer and every offer ther eafter .\\n \\n \\n1) Affiliates Give Y our Lead Magnet A way When Somebody\\nBuys Their Stuff. The idea here is for your lead magnet to make\\nthe af filiate’ s of fer more valuable. This allows them to char ge more\\nfor it and  get more leads than they could without it. Remember , the\\nbest lead magnets give away a free trial or sample of your thing,\\nreveal a problem, or of fer a single step of a multi-step solution.\\nHere are examples of each:\\n \\nSamples And T rials : Say I sell massages and recruit the personal\\ntraining studio next door as an af filiate. Now , everyone who buys\\npersonal training from them gets a free massage from me. The\\npersonal training studio now has a stronger of fer they can char ge\\nmore for and we get more massage leads. Everybody wins.\\n \\nReveal a Problem : Instead of giving a free massage, we of fer a free\\nor discounted posture assessment with every training package they\\nsell. Assessments and discounts add less value to the af filiate’ s\\nof fer , but some people will still do it. And to be clear , after\\nassessing the customer , you make them an of fer to solve the\\nproblems you revealed.\\n \\nOne Step In A Multi-Step Process : Say you have a three-part\\ntreatment plan. Massage, stretching, and adjustments. People\\ngetting enough value from one step will fear missing out on the\\nrest of the steps. So the more they think the other steps will help\\nsolve their lar ger problem, the more likely they are to buy them.\\nY our af filiate would give away step one of your multi-step process\\nfor free. Y ou’d upsell the leads from there.\\n \\nWhat I did.  W e’d get gym af filiates to give away a free nutrition\\nconsult to every new member . Then, we’d upsell our products at\\nthe consult. They can market that they have nutrition consults\\nincluded to get more leads and they could char ge more for the\\nadded value. And we get the opportunity to sell those leads.\\nEverybody wins.\\n \\n \\n \\nThey sell their cor e offer . Then, they upsell your lead magnet.\\nThen, you upsell your cor e offer and every offer ther eafter .\\n \\n2) Affiliates Sell Y our Lead Magnet . Basically , the af filiate can\\nsell anything of yours that turns their customers into your\\ncustomers. It could be a book, an event, a service, software, a\\nsample product, etc. Also, giving af filiates all the cash from selling\\na lead magnet you fulfill  becomes all profit and no work for them–\\nan attractive proposition for any business. Y our money comes by\\nselling your main thing for more than it cost you to deliver your\\nlead magnet. And if you do it this way , you don\\'t need to split any\\nmoney with them on your core of fer . Another win-win.\\n \\nExample: They sell each of those things we gave away for free in\\nthe step above . They sell your massage at a discounted price. They\\nsell your assessment (which you could do 1-1 or in a group format\\nlike a workshop). They sell part one of your multi-step solution.\\n \\nWhat I did.  The gyms would sell a nutrition consult with us and\\nkeep the money . They’d maybe char ge $99 or $199 to sell an hour\\nof our time. If we were clever , we’d let them keep all the money . If\\nwe do, they’ll send us even more leads. Then, we’d upsell our\\nproducts during the consult.\\n \\n \\n…then you split the money . Either you split the upfr ont cash, all\\ncash for a certain period of time, or all cash for ever . I pr efer to pay\\nfor ever so my affiliates stay motivated to keep my customers\\nfor ever . And, I never cap payouts.\\n \\n3) Affiliates Sell Y our Cor e Offer . An af filiate sells your core\\nof fer directly to their customers and adds another source of income\\nwithout extra work. For some af filiates, this is their entire source of\\nincome! Many companies of fer this structure as either a new\\nbusiness opportunity or a bolt-on to the af filiate’ s existing\\nbusiness. Either way , anything you sell, they can sell. When you do\\nit this way , the af filiate will get a higher percentage of your\\nlifetime gross profit - but - you won’ t have to do anything but\\ndeliver .\\n \\nExample : They sell your entire massage package. They sell your\\nentire program or services. They bundle their services with your\\npaid services and char ge an even higher price.\\n \\nWhat I did.  W e taught gyms to hold nutrition consultations with\\nwhite labeled products. Then we taught them to upsell our\\nsupplements right to their members and we split the money .\\n \\n \\nAll three strategies work. They’re just dif ferent. After testing, we\\ncontinue to do Strategy 1 (twice per year as a big event) and\\nStrategy 3 on an ongoing basis. That being said, many similar\\nbusinesses in our portfolio use Strategy 2. I\\'m just sharing what\\nworked for us.\\n \\nBottom Line : Integration is the long term strategy for using\\naf filiates to get enduring lead flow . T reat af filiates like customers.\\nMake your of fer make sense for their business. Make it so good\\nthey’d feel stupid saying no.\\n \\nAction Step:  Integrate with your af filiates by choosing whether\\nyou want them to give your lead magnet away , to sell your lead\\nmagnet, or to sell your core of fer directly .\\n \\nThose are the six steps to recruiting an af filiate army . Now that we\\ncovered that, let me give you three real-life case studies to drive\\nthis home.\\n \\n \\nThr ee Case Studies Y ou Can Model\\n \\nService Business Case Study #1: National T ax Preparation\\nServices\\n \\nMy friend\\'s $50M business prepares LLCs, bank accounts, and\\narticles of incorporation. He focuses on people starting businesses\\nfor the first time. But, he doesn\\'t try to compete with Legalzoom.\\nInstead, he built it partnering with people who train new\\nentrepreneurs. His strategy is simple: help those people sell more\\nof their stuf f by also selling his stuf f. So, he of fers every af filiate’ s\\ncustomer a free LLC setup. Remember learning about the “high\\ncost lead magnet” from Section II? This is one of those.\\n \\nLaunch : He does a big blast of f seminar to his af filiates’ audiences\\nto kick things of f. People happily take him up on his free LLC\\nof fer . That\\'s his lead magnet.\\n \\nIntegrate : Once af filiates see the success of the launch, they\\nintegrate his lead magnet into their core of fer . Then, my friend’ s\\nteam gets on the phone with the customers his affiliates bring him\\nfor fr ee . Here\\'s how he makes his money . He sells them what\\nthey\\'ll need next. The services they\\'ll need to start their business:\\nbookkeeping, tax preparation, etc.\\n \\nHe hasn’ t spent a dollar on paid ads. His true advertising costs are\\ntwo things. One, delivering his free lead magnet (the LLC setup).\\nAnd two, paying a percentage of every first sale to the af filiates\\nthat sent them. That\\'s it. And everybody wins.\\n \\nPhysical Products Case Study #2: Prestige Labs, my supplement\\ncompany\\n \\nW e sell gym owners at Gym Launch and train them how to\\nadvertise and sell their gym memberships. Prestige Labs has a line\\nof supplements for active adults. This makes Gym Launch a\\nperfect af filiate for Prestige Labs. It has a community of gym\\nowners that also have active adult customers.  So when Gym\\nLaunch sells a new gym owner , they introduce the new gym\\nowners to Prestige Labs. Then the Prestige Labs team follows the\\n“launch then integrate” strategy above. (W e really do this).\\n \\nLaunch : W e give the gym owners advertising materials so they\\ncan re-engage their current and former customers. W e focus on\\nwarm outreach and posting free content for a free 28 day\\nchallenge. When they come in for the free challenge, gym owners\\nsell them supplements to use with the program. The gym owner\\ngets more customers. They make money . W e make money .\\nEveryone wins.\\n \\nIntegrate : After the launch, we teach them to sell supplements to\\nevery new  gym member . So when new clients buy a membership\\npackage, the gym owner sets up a nutrition orientation. At the\\nnutrition orientation, the gym owner sells them $50-$1000 of\\nsupplements. So if a gym signs up twenty clients per month, and\\ngets seventy percent of them to buy supplements, we get fourteen\\nnew customers per month per gym. It doesn’ t sound like much, but\\nwhen you multiply 4000 gyms x 14 new sales per month x $200\\naverage order = a lot of money every month.\\n \\nLocal Business Case Study #3: Chiropractors\\n \\nChiropractors want new patients. And a portfolio company of ours\\nteaches them to use an af filiate strategy to get them. Their model is\\nsimple: go to high volume businesses that have people that are in\\nneed of adjustments. A gym fits the bill nicely . Here’ s what they\\ndo.\\n \\nLaunch : They get the gym owner to promote a three hour\\nworkshop where they show correct exercises and posture to get\\nmore from their workouts. The gym owner promotes the workshop\\nfor free or  sells the workshop for $29-$99 per person. The\\nchiropractor splits the money with the gym owner . Hint: if you\\ngive the af filiate (gym owner in this case) 100% of the money ,\\nthey’ll want to do it more. So if a gym gets thirty people to show\\nup for $99, they make $2970 profit for zero work besides a few\\nemails and posts. At the workshop the chiropractor soft pitches\\ntheir services and gets a bucket of new patients. Easy peasy lemon\\nsqueezy .\\n \\nIntegrate : Long term, the chiropractor convinces the gym owner\\nto include one to two adjustments with every new membership the\\ngym signs up. This increases the value of the gym membership\\ncompared to the guy down the street. And, it shows the gym\\nprioritizes its members health and safety (a big concern for\\nbeginners). W in win. Now , every new gym member becomes a\\nlead for the chiropractor to follow up with. They repeat this\\nprocess with thirty gyms, and get more patients than they can\\nhandle.\\n \\n \\n \\nCosts and Returns\\n \\n \\n“Affiliates can’ t work for my business” the loser said.\\n“I have to make affiliates work for my business” the winner said.\\nBe a winner .\\n \\nWhen calculating returns with other methods, we compared\\nlifetime gross profit (L TGP) with cost to acquire a customer\\n(CAC). So we spend money to get customers and the customers, in\\na profitable business, give us mor e  money back. Af filiates work\\ndif ferently . W e spend money to get af filiates, sure. But we don’ t\\nreally make much back fr om  af filiates themselves. Instead, the\\nmoney we spend to get an af filiate comes back fr om the customers\\nthey bring us. So to calculate returns, we compare how much it\\ncosts us to get an af filiate with the gross profit of all  the customers\\nthey send to our business.\\n \\nExample:\\n \\nLet’ s say we own a widget company that grows with af filiates.\\n \\n●    It costs us $4000 in advertising to get an af filiate. CAC = $4000\\n \\n●    Our average af filiate sells $10,000 in widgets per month and stays\\nfor 12 months.\\n \\n○    ($10,000 per month ) x (12 months) = $120,000 total sales\\n \\n●    The widgets have 75% gross mar gins. In other words, they cost\\n25% of retail price to make.\\n \\n○    ($120,000 total sales) x (25% cost of goods) = $30,000 total\\ncost of goods\\n \\n○    ($120,000 total sales ) - ($30,000 total cost of goods) =\\n$90,000 in gross profit from all the customers the af filiate\\nbrings \\n \\n●    W e pay af filiates 40% of the gross profit:\\n \\n○    ($90,000 gross profit) x (40% payout) = $36,000 to the\\naf filiate as payment.\\n \\n●    Here’ s the gross profit we have left after cost of goods and payouts:\\n \\n○    ($120,000 total) - ($30,000 costs) - ($36,000 payouts) =\\n$54,000 leftover \\n \\n●    Let’ s find our af filiate L TGP to CAC ratio: \\n \\n○    ($54,000 gross profit left) / ($4000 to get an af filiate) = 12.5 :\\n1 \\n \\n…Not too shabby .\\n \\n \\nIf you recall from earlier , we need to be at least  at 3:1 to have a\\ndecent business. Like the example, we want the ratio even higher\\nthan that (5:1, 10:1+). Now , if we had these numbers, we’d just do\\nmor e . But, if your actual L TGP : CAC is less than 3, here are the\\nthree ways to improve it:\\n \\n1) Lower CAC: W e get af filiates for less  (by improving our ads, of fer ,\\nand sales process).\\n \\n2) Increase L TGP & Decrease CAC: Get more to activate  (by creating\\na launch process).\\n \\n3) Increase L TGP: W e make them worth mor e  (by improving our\\nintegration process).\\n \\nW ith af filiates, you now have at least two layers of customers.\\nY our customers, and the people who get you customers. And if\\nyou’ve got super -af filiates you add a third, the people who get you\\nthe people who get you customers! This adds complexity , but if\\nyou can manage it, it’ s worth it.\\n \\nNow that you understand how to use af filiates to advertise, and\\nhow to make them more profitable– let’ s bring it all home.\\n \\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nLike referrals, af filiates aren’ t an advertising method you can ‘do.’\\nThey’re people who advertise your stuf f to benefit you both. Y ou\\ndo the core four to get them, and if you want them to love you,\\nthen you tr eat them like customers . Because in a lot of ways, they\\nar e . And if you deliver more value to them than it costs them to get\\nit (especially hidden costs), they’ll get you more leads than you can\\nhandle.\\n \\nAnd like we learned earlier , there are two ways to create a\\ncompounding business. Y ou can find more people that never stop\\nbuying your stuf f or  you can find more people who never stop\\nselling it for you.  Referrals are the former . Af filiates are the ladder .\\n \\nIn theory , once you build an af filiate army , you never need to\\nadvertise again. They keep getting you leads month after month.\\nThe main reason - it makes sense for them. The way you do\\nbusiness, your leadership, and the value of your product all come\\ninto play . Y ou are only as good as the goodwill you have with your\\naf filiate partners. Arrange it right and you should both be better of f\\nfrom the relationship. They should be able to spend more to\\nacquire customers through a more compelling of fer , higher profits,\\nor both. And, in return, you get more engaged leads. So why\\ndoesn’ t everyone do this? They don’ t know it’ s possible. They\\ndon’ t know how . Or , they don’ t want to. Simple as that. Hopefully\\nwe solved all three of those issues at once.\\n \\nRemember , advertising always works , it’ s only a matter of\\nef ficiency . So once you start, keep going until it works.\\n \\n \\nAction Steps\\n \\nAdvertise your af filiate of fer until you get ten to twenty af filiates.\\nGet results with those af filiates and use their feedback to work the\\nkinks out of your of fer , terms, launches, and integration strategy .\\nThen, scale like crazy by turning their results into your first batch\\nof af filiate lead magnets.\\n \\n \\n\\nS e c t i o n  I V  C o n c l u s i o n :  G e t  L e a d  G e t t e r s\\n“The last skill you ever need to learn is how to get other people to\\ndo everything you need for you.”\\n \\nW e do the core four to get engaged leads: warm outreach, post\\ncontent, cold outreach, and paid ads. And we use them to get two\\ntypes of engaged leads: the ones that become customers, or the\\nones we turn into lead getters. Lead getters come in four flavors:\\nReferrers, Employees, Agencies, and Af filiates. Each have key\\nstrengths:\\n \\nCustomer referrals have the biggest potential for low-cost\\nexponential growth.\\n \\nEmployees have your dir ect  influence and run your business on\\nyour behalf.\\n \\nAgencies teach skills you keep forever and can transfer to your\\nteam.\\n \\nAf filiates, once you get them going, can operate entirely on their\\nown.\\n \\nY ou can either do the advertising or other people can. And there\\nare more “other people” than there are of you. Y ou get mor e leads\\nfor the work you do when you have help.  So if you want to get a\\nton of leads, this is the way .\\n \\nMaybe your head is of ficially spinning. Now that you understand\\nthese advertising methods, you see leads everywhere you look. W e\\nhave so many ways to gr ow! And you’d be right. But...you don\\'t\\nknow which one to focus on.\\n \\nAny or all of these lead methods can underpin a successful lead-\\ngetting strategy , and I put them in the order of what happens\\nnaturally . If you start on your own, you tend to get your first\\nreferrals before you start building a big team. And when you start\\nbuilding a big team (employees) you’ll probably start looking for\\nprofessional help (agencies). And only when a business owner has\\na handle on managing people inside of their business do they tend\\nto get the guts to try and manage people outside their business\\n(af filiates). In any case, you have to for get the idea that everything\\nis going to work out the first time.\\n \\nIf you think you’re going to become a millionaire the first year you\\ngo out on your own, you’re probably wrong. It’ s very unlikely .\\nAnd an obsession with “getting rich quick” will likely ensure it\\nnever happens. People try shortcuts for a decade until they realize\\nthey should have picked a strategy and stuck with it for a decade. If\\nyou do that, success is inevitable. Once you find something that\\nworks for you– stick to what you pick. Those are the best words of\\nencouragement I can of fer . The longer you play the game, the\\nbetter you will get, and the more success you will have.  Just don\\'t\\nquit or switch methods after seeing a few losses . It’ s normal to lose\\nin the beginning. In fact, I expect  to crack a new lead source in\\nthree to six months (and this isn’ t my first rodeo). So if your\\nexpectations are faster  than that, do you think your expectations\\nare reasonable?              \\n \\nW e covered a lot here. This section was how you scale: you get\\nother people to help you. They are the missing link. Each has their\\nown strategy and best practices. Use what applies to you now .\\n \\nThis leads us to Section V : Get Started. I want to put everything\\ntogether for you in a nice bow so you know exactly what to do\\nnext .

But it is,\\nper haps, the end of the beginning”\\n-W inston Chur chill\\n \\n \\nJune 2017. Thr ee months after we lost it all, again, and switched\\nGym Launch to licensing.\\n \\n“Hey Leila, what do you make of this?” I asked.\\n \\n“What’ s up?”\\n \\nI gave her my phone.\\n \\nMr . and Mrs. Hormozi, we cor dially invite you to a private event\\nfor entr epr eneurs earning eight figur es and up. Let me know if\\nyou’r e inter ested.\\n \\n“Seems cool” she said. “...but we’re not making eight figures?”\\n \\nI pretended not to hear her . “Y ou wanna go?”\\n \\n“Sure. Is it included in our mentorship dues?”\\n \\n“One sec, I’ll ask”\\n \\nAn email response came a moment later:\\n \\nNo, this is an additional fee. It is a two-day event limited to ten\\npeople at a private r esort.\\n \\n“Nope” I said.\\n \\n“Huh. Can we af ford to go?”  Ouch.\\n \\n“Who cares? W e can’ t af ford not to go.”\\n \\n10 days, a long flight, and a short drive later…\\n \\nW e made it. The “cool kids” meet up. I had one goal, to add as\\nmuch value as I could to everyone else in the room. But the\\nmoment I walked in, I knew I was out of my league. I recognized\\nalmost everyone there. They were famous in the advertising world.\\nThey all spoke at huge events. Signed autographs. Made millions.\\nThen, there was me. I wasn’ t an eight-figure entrepreneur . I was a\\nkid from Baltimore just paying to breathe everyone else’ s air .\\n \\nOnce everyone settled we had a short housekeeping discussion and\\nthen got down to business. This way of doing things was a sharp\\ncontrast to the big stages, booming sound systems, flashing lights,\\nand other theatrics that “real” events have.\\n \\nThe first speaker was ready to go. He had a ‘man bun’ and loose\\nyoga-ish clothing. He looked like a hippie. But then, he opened\\nwith how he was only  doing $3,000,000 per month… is this for\\nr eal!? I felt like a fraud. The numbers he shared with such a casual\\nattitude blew my mind. How is this possible?\\n \\nHe continued on with his talk using all sorts of business,\\nadvertising, and tech jar gon. He pointed to dizzying charts and\\ngraphs. I came here to learn more about advertising but felt dumber\\nby the second. I recognized enough of the words to realize I knew\\nnothing useful about them. His presentation went way  over my\\nhead. I started sweating bullets. Leila grabbed my hand. W e both\\nfelt stressed and out of our depths.\\n \\nHe finished and finally opened up for Q&A. Excellent . But the\\nquestions were still at the same level as his presentation. Nope, I’m\\nstill doomed.  Then, an awkward voice cracked.“So uhh… What\\ncourses are you taking to learn all this stuf f?” Now we’r e talking.  I\\nleaned in. Pen in hand. His answer changed my life:\\n \\n“At this point, I don’ t expect to learn anything new from courses. I\\nhave to learn by doing. And I ‘do’ by spending a percentage of my\\nrevenue to test new campaigns, new channels, new pages, or just\\nplain crazy ideas. And I learn something every time I test, so the\\nmoney is well spent. Whenever one of these tests is a winner , and\\nsome  are, it’ s a big deal. I learn something amazing and make far\\nmore money than I spent. It raises the bar for my business and,\\nmore importantly , myself. So whether it\\'s 1%, 5%, or 10%, set\\nsome per centage of your advertising budget aside to try new things\\nwithout expecting a return. Consider it an investment in your\\neducation.”\\n \\nI felt chills go through me like some judgment demon left my\\nbody . He gave me permission to fail.\\n \\nNone of this is magic. If he can do this, so can I.\\n \\n***\\n \\nThe next week, I tripled  my advertising budget. Y es, it was a bit\\naggressive. But my mindset had completely changed. I’d either\\nmake more, or get better:\\n \\nOur business went from $400,000 in June to $780,000 in July .\\nFrom there, my cost to get customers went up too high. So I tried\\nnew audiences. Most failed. Then, a hit. Boom, we cruised past\\n$1M to $1.2M to $1.5M per month.\\n \\nThen, I realized we didn’ t follow up with our engaged leads… at\\nall. W e tested email. Didn’ t work. W e tested phone calls. Nothin’.\\nThen I tried text blasts. Wham, we zoomed to $1.8M the next\\nmonth.\\n \\nFrom there, we tested paid ads like crazy . W e made way more of\\nthem and  put more focus on their production value. Boom. W e\\ncruised past $2.5M per month.\\n \\nThen, we launched our af filiate program and stacked another\\n$1.5M per month on top . That took us past $4m per month. Y ears\\nlater , our portfolio now does more than $16,000,000 per month.\\n \\nSo test until you find something that works. T ake massive action.\\nStay focused. Double down on it until it breaks. Then test until you\\nfind the next thing that works, and double down on that.  T aking\\nthese leaps are the only way to unlock the business you want and\\nthe life that comes with it. And maybe, slay your judgment demon\\ntoo.\\n \\nSo from now on…\\n \\nY ou either win or you learn.\\n \\n \\nThe End of the Beginning\\n \\nY our speed to making big money depends on how fast you learn\\nthe skills to making big money . Getting more engaged leads with\\nthe skills of advertising, is a great start to making more money . In\\nfact, if you make any  amount of money , more engaged leads will\\nmake you even more. And, sadly , those skills take time to learn.  So\\nI share my experiences to shave years of f your time. T o shorten the\\ngap between no money and mo’ money . It’ s time to make it\\nhappen.\\n \\n \\nOutline Of The “Get Started” Section\\n \\nThis final section has three chapters. They are short and sweet, just\\nlike our time together .\\n \\nIn the first chapter , Advertising in real life– I’ll lay out my one big\\nadvertising rule.

Then, to\\nsend you on your way , I’ll share a parable that has gotten me\\nthrough even my hardest times.\\nA d v e r t i s i n g  i n  R e a l  L i f e :  O p e n  T o  G o a l\\nIf some is good, mor e is better .\\n \\n \\nJune 2014.\\n \\nWhen I launched my first gym, I used the same paid ads I used at\\nSam’ s gym from way back. And they worked, for a while. Over\\ntime, the costs started creeping up. I got less leads for the same\\nmoney . But, I still needed more customers. I wasn’ t sure what to\\ndo.\\n \\nI talked to a mentor who ran a chain of tanning salons for some\\nadvice. He said “before all this fancy internet stuf f, flyers crushed\\nfor us, you should try those.” So, try them we did. W e printed 300.\\nOver the next day , we put them on cars in areas close to the gym.\\nA day passed. Nothing. The next day , the phone rang. Finally!\\n \\n“Hey , you put a flyer on my car–” My heart raced. It worked!\\n \\n“–Y es, yes I did! How can I–?” But before I could finish, he\\ninterrupted right back.\\n \\n“–yea, you scratched my Mercedes…” Crap. “...you’re gonna need\\nto pay for–” I panicked and hung up the phone. He called back. I\\nlet it ring. He never called again. That was the only call I got from\\nthe flyers. No leads. Nothing.\\n \\nUniverse: 1. Alex: 0.\\n \\n \\nA few weeks later\\n \\nI sat in the lobby of my gym waiting for customers to fall into my\\nlap. Feeling bored, and a bit frustrated, I called the mentor with the\\n‘bright idea’ to put out flyers.\\n \\n“Hey Alex - how\\'s it going?”\\n \\n“Uh, not too good.”\\n \\n“Why what\\'s up?”\\n \\n“W e put out the flyers like you said.”\\n \\n“Oh yea, how many leads you get from ‘em?”\\n \\n“None.”\\n \\n“Hmm…that’ s odd.” He paused. “What was your test size?”\\n \\n“What do you mean?”\\n \\n“Y ou know , how many did you put out?”\\n \\n“I put out 300.” I said in a resentful tone.\\n \\n“Shoot, you only put out 300? Hard to know if anything works\\nwith such a small number…I test with 5000. Then when we find a\\nwinner , we put out 5000 per day , every day , for a month…”\\n \\nFive  thousand ? He tests  with almost seventeen times more than my\\nentire “campaign.” And he does it in a single day . I felt like the\\nperson who says exercise doesn’ t work after going to the gym one\\ntime. And I hate  that person.\\n \\n“...I mean what kind of response did you think you were gonna\\nget?” he chuckled. “If we get half a percent, that’ s decent. If we get\\none percent, that’ s a winner . W ith 300 flyers, half a percent would\\nbe like one and a half people. That makes it pretty hard to know if\\nyou got a winner or not.”\\n \\nI had nothing to say . He was right. I felt like a fool .\\n \\nI doubt he remembers the call. But, it stuck with me. I promised\\nmyself I would never  let ef fort be the reason anything  didn\\'t work\\nfor me. It could be something else. The of fer . The copy . The image.\\nThe tar geting. The media. The platform. The position of the moon.\\nBut not. my . effort.\\n \\nThose 300 measly flyers taught me a mondo lesson. I did the right\\nstuf f, but I didn\\'t do it enough times. I lacked what can be\\ndescribed in a single word: volume.\\n \\nNeil Strauss once said “Success comes down to doing the obvious\\nthing for an uncommonly long period of time without convincing\\nyourself you’re smarter than you are.” The right action in the\\nwrong amount still fails. Most people, myself included, stop too\\nsoon . W e don’ t do enough.\\n \\nMost people dramatically underestimate the volume it takes to\\nmake advertising work. They\\'re not doing half as much or a third\\nas much as is required. In fact, they\\'re doing dramatically less. I\\nwas doing 1/1500th the level of ef fort required to make a flyer\\ncampaign work– I just didn\\'t know it.\\n \\nI hear this all the time. “Alex, I reached out to 100 people over the\\nlast six weeks, I only got one customer , it doesn’ t work.”\\nResponse: “Y ou did 1/42 of the amount of work required. It was\\n100 per day , not 100 over time.”\\n \\nMost people do not get that advertising is an inputs and outputs\\ngame. T o them, outputs appear out of their control. Their low ef fort\\ninputs get them their low and unreliable output of engaged leads.\\nW e’re ending that now . Y ou input advertising ef fort. Y our output is\\nengaged leads. Period. Now , we are crystal clear on the stuf f you\\ndo (the core four). And like we learned when maximizing the core\\nfour–Y ou just gotta put in mor e  and do it better than before. W e\\nstarted with the rule of 100–but when you make that the norm,\\nyou’re ready to take it to the next level with…\\n \\n \\nRule of 100 on Ster oids–Open T o Goal\\n \\nA very successful gym chain allowed their sales managers to make\\ntheir own schedules. But there was a catch–they had to sign up five\\nnew members per day  no matter what.  So if they did it by lunch,\\nthey could cut out early . But if it took 18 hours, so be it. They\\ncalled this type of work schedule ‘open-to-goal’.\\n \\nI’ve found that elite entrepreneurs and salespeople across\\nindustries do some variation of ‘open to goal’. This is because it’ s\\nlike the rule of 100… but for the big kids. Y ou don’ t just commit to\\ndoing something a specific number of times… you commit to the\\nwork until you hit a specific number of outcomes–no matter what.\\nSo it means you unlock a whole new level of ef fort you never even\\nrealized you had. It might mean only doing something fifty times\\nto get the desired result. Or , like the flyers, five thousand times,\\nevery day , for years .\\n \\nIf you want to take your advertising to the next level - work until\\nthe job is done.  Give up the idea of ‘doing your best.’ Instead, do\\nwhat is required. And sometimes that means your best just needs to\\nget better .\\n \\n \\nHow I Make Open T o Goal W ork For Myself\\n \\n \\nIf I had to pick the three habits that best served me in my life - they\\nwould be:\\n \\n1) W aking up early (4-5 am) –Pro tip, this actually means  going to\\nbed early …\\n \\n2) Getting right to work –No rituals. No routines. I drink cof fee and\\nget to work.\\n \\n3) No meetings until noon –No interruptions. Nothing. Fully\\nfocused work time.\\n \\nT o be clear , I don’ t think there’ s any magic to waking up early . But\\nI do think there’ s magic in a long stretch of uninterrupted work\\nimmediately after a long stretch uninterrupted sleep. After all, it’ s\\nthe most productive hours in a row of the most productive work I\\ncan do… with nothing getting in my way… Every . Single. Day .\\nHow can you lose?\\n \\nAnd since I have a good idea of what I can do in a day , I set my\\ndaily goal accordingly . Then, only after my dedicated block of\\nwork–do I go put out fires, talk to humans, and deal with the other\\nday to day stuf f.\\n \\nW aking up early , getting right to work, and working 8 hours\\nstraight has been my highest ROI “habit stack.” By a longshot. If\\nyou choose to try it, I hope it serves you as well as it has served me\\n(or better). And for those of you thinking “W ait! That’ s more than\\ntwelve hours of work a day!” Y ou’re right. I’m playing to win. But\\nif it overwhelms you at first, I get it. Just throttle it back a few\\nhours and then work your way up. Some days it’ s tough, but I\\nalways like to remind myself:\\n \\n“Do mor e than they do, and you will have mor e than they have.”\\n \\nSince my job is usually to “get more customers” in most of my\\ncompanies, advertising is what I focus on. This book, for example,\\nwas written exclusively in that open to goal time block. Why?\\nBecause it’ s an asset that can bring me more companies.\\n \\nSo, if you’re gonna follow my high ROI habit stack, then you’re\\ngonna want a clear action plan for that time. This is the simplest\\nadvertising plan I can give you.\\nOne Page Advertising Checklist\\n \\nStep #1:  Pick The T ype Of Engaged Lead T o Get: Customers,\\nAf filiates, Employees, or Agencies\\n \\nStep #2:  Pick Rule of 100 or Open T o Goal. Commit T o Y our\\nDaily Advertising Actions\\n \\n \\nStep #3: Fill Out The Advertising Checklist For That Daily Action\\n \\n \\nStep #4:  Do this daily action until you have enough money to\\naf ford paying someone else to do it.\\n \\nStep #5: When you do, go back to step 1. Make employees your\\nnew tar get lead type. And repeat steps 1-4 until you have the help\\nyou need. Then, scale again.\\n \\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nLots of pages. So many ideas. W e’re almost at the end. But, you\\ndon’ t have any more leads. What gives? Answer: Reading doesn’ t\\nget people interested in the stuf f you sell… advertising does. If\\nyou’re not telling anyone about the stuf f you sell, then you aren’ t\\ngetting anyone interested in the stuf f you sell. Period.\\n \\nThis chapter laid out the plan to advertise in the simplest way I\\ncould:\\n \\nW ork ‘open to goal.’\\n \\nStructure your day to make open to goal possible.\\n \\nCreate and  commit to that goal with the one page advertising \\nchecklist. \\n \\nMany skip planning, or worse, they write a one hundred page plan\\nthat never gets used. So skip the atrocious waste of time that is\\nwriting pages of baloney . Harness the power of laying out your\\naction steps on a single page . It leaves little room for excuses,\\ndistractions, and delusions. Y ou either did the stuf f or you didn’ t.\\nY ou can fill out your one page advertising checklist in about five\\nminutes. And once the naked truth stares back at you, all you have\\nleft is to do it .             \\n \\n \\n\\nT h e  R o a d m a p  -  P u t t i n g  i t  A l l  T o g e t h e r\\nZero to $100,000,000\\n \\n“A leader must aim high, see big, judge widely , thus setting himself\\napart fr om the or dinary people who debate in narr ow confines.”\\n- Charles de Gaulle,\\nFr ench Pr esident During W orld W ar II\\n \\n \\nT o get to where you want to go, it pays to know what lies ahead.\\nSo in this chapter , I describe the phases you will go through as you\\nscale your advertising. Acquisition.com uses this roadmap to scale\\nour portfolio companies from a few million a year , all the way to\\n$100,000,000+. These levels will help you identify where you are\\non the advertising totem pole so you know what to do to get to the\\nnext level.\\n \\nLevel 1: Y our friends know about the stuff you sell.  T o start getting\\nengaged leads, you make one of fer , to one avatar , on one platform.\\nThe moment you get engaged leads, is the moment you can start\\nmaking money . For me, this started with reaching out to everyone  I\\nknew .\\n \\nPrimary Action : W arm outreach.\\n \\nLevel 2:  Y ou  consistently  let everyone you know  about the stuff you\\nsell. Y ou know the exact inputs to get an engaged lead with your\\nchosen advertising method. And, by scaling those inputs, you get\\nconsistent  customers with it. But the consistent customers come\\nfrom maximizing your personal work capacity . For me, on top of\\nwarm reach outs, I maximized my personal work capacity with\\npaid aids, using a case study as my lead magnet. But looking back,\\nI wish I would have started with posting free content. So I suggest\\nthat.\\n \\nPrimary Actions:  Do as much warm outreach and post as much\\ncontent as you can consistently .\\n \\nLevel 3: Y ou  get employees to help you do mor e advertising.\\nY ou’ve maxed your personal advertising inputs, but not the\\nplatform. And if you want more engaged leads that can only mean\\none thing. Doing more. For me, I hired a videographer and a media\\nbuyer to take most of the paid ads work of f my plate.\\n \\nPrimary Action:  Y ou hire people to advertise profitably on your\\nbehalf.\\n \\nLevel 4 : Y our pr oduct is good enough to get consistent r eferrals.\\nY ou continue building goodwill and shoot for getting 25% or more\\nof your customers from referrals. Now , you’ve set yourself up to\\nramp your advertising again. But to make that work, you have to\\nget more serious about hiring a team to make it happen.\\n \\nThis is when I realized that my ads were shut of f but I was still\\ngetting referrals every week. So, I doubled down on referrals. I\\nbuilt goodwill using customer feedback to update my product\\nevery two weeks.  I also started a strong referral program with big\\nincentives at the same time.\\n \\nPrimary Actions:  Focus on your product until you get consistent\\nreferrals then go back to scaling your advertising with a bigger\\nteam. This is where most people mess up. They let their product\\nslip and never recover .\\n \\nLevel 5:  Y ou  advertise in mor e places in mor e ways with mor e\\npeople.  First, you expand to new audiences on your best platform.\\nThen, you make ads with all placements and media types the\\nplatform supports. And, after your team can get consistent results,\\nyou expand your team again to add: another platform, lead-getter ,\\nor cor e four activity .\\n \\nFor me, I hit two birds with one stone. I expanded my paid ads to\\ninclude potential af filiates. And this paved the way for my af filiate\\nprograms.\\n \\nPrimary Action : Advertise profitably using at least two methods on\\nmultiple platforms.\\n \\nLevel 6: Y ou  hir e killers. Y our executives grow departments\\nspecific to an advertising method or platform without you. And\\nyou\\'re not looking for potential. Y ou\\'re looking for experienced\\nleaders specializing in exactly what you want. W e capped here.\\n \\nIt took me three years to figure out two things. One, that I needed\\nveteran executives with experience suited to my problems. And\\ntwo, that they needed stronger incentives. But by the time I\\nrealized this, I sold those companies. Once I started\\nAcquisition.com I realized the power of expanding the pie to get\\nmore of the right people invested in winning. This is how we\\ncrossed $100M+ then $200M+ in portfolio revenue and beyond.\\n \\nPrimary Action : Get battle-hardened executives and department\\nheads to take over new advertising activities and channels.\\n \\n \\n \\nLevel 7:  I’ll come back and edit this chapter once I cross a billion.\\nI promise, I’ll send the lessons as soon as I have them. Y ou have\\nmy word.\\n \\nLast Points : I know this looks clean. But it never is. Real business\\nis messy . It takes a lot  to find what audiences, lead magnets,\\nmethods, and platforms work best. And you can only find out what\\nworks if you try . So you have to try a lot of dif ferent things, a lot of\\ndif ferent ways, for a long enough time to know for sure.\\n \\nNobody  can ever know the absolute best thing to do. But I do know\\nthis: the more you advertise, the more people find out about the\\nstuf f you sell. The more people who know about the stuf f you sell,\\nthe more people will buy it. This is the key to the $100M Leads\\nMachine.\\n \\n \\nThe $100M+ Lead Machine\\n \\n \\nLet’ s look into your future. Y our business makes $100,000,000+\\nannual revenue. It’ s great to have a clear picture of what the\\n$100M machine looks like. Let’ s have a look, shall we? First and\\nforemost, your advertising fires on all cylinders…\\n \\nY our media team scales tons of free content, in all media types,\\non many platforms.\\n \\nY ou regularly make of fers to your warm audience to get more\\ncustomers or af filiates.\\n \\nY our ravenous audience makes anything  you launch immediately\\nprofitable.\\n \\nY ou have teams running and scaling profitable paid ads across\\nmultiple platforms. \\n \\nY our cold outreach team gets you more customers.\\n \\nY ou have an af filiate manager launching and integrating all new\\naf filiates.\\n \\nY ou have recruiters and  recruiting agencies bringing in more\\nlead getters.\\n \\nY our product is so good that a third of your customers bring you\\nmore customers.\\n \\nY our executive team drives all this growth without you.\\n \\nAnd… you have mor e engaged leads than you can possibly\\nhandle.\\n \\nHow long does this take? For business owners who know what to\\ndo–anywhere from five to ten years. Building something great,\\neven if you know exactly what to do, takes time. And so many like\\nto trumpet “overnight success,” but looking behind the curtain tells\\na dif ferent story . It took my wife and I mor e than ten years of our\\nbest effort, to cross the first $100M in net worth. So the bigger\\nyour goals, the longer your time horizons need to be. Y ou want to\\nplay games where if you wait, you win.\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nA  D e c a d e  i n  a  P a g e\\n“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication” - Leonar do Da V inci\\n \\nW e’ve covered a lot. And I think or ganizing what we learned into\\none place helps it sink in. So I made this “back of the napkin” list\\nof what we’ve covered and why .\\n \\n1)  How to define a lead from this point forward. Now you know\\nwhat you’re after: engaged leads, not just leads.\\n \\n2)  How to turn leads into engaged leads with an of fer or lead\\nmagnet. And, how to make them. \\n \\n3)  The Cor e Four  - the only four ways we can let people know\\nabout the stuf f we sell. \\n \\na)   How to reach out to people who know us: ask them if\\nthey know anybody \\n \\nb)  How to post publicly: hook, r etain, r ewar d. Give until\\nthey ask.\\n \\nc)   How to reach out to strangers: lists, personalization, big\\nfast value, volume\\n \\nd)  How to run paid ads to strangers: tar geting, callouts,\\nWhat-Who-Whens, CT As, client financed acquisition\\n \\n4)  Maximizing the Core Four:  Mor e Better  New\\n \\na)   What keeps us from doing what I’m currently doing at\\nten times the volume? Then solving for that.\\n \\nb)  Finding the constraint in our advertising. Then testing\\nuntil it frees the constraint. Then doing mor e  until it gets\\nconstrained again. \\n \\n5)  The Four Lead Getters: Customers, Employees, Agencies, and\\nAffiliates\\n \\na)   How to get customers to refer other customers \\n \\nb)  How to get employees to scale your advertising without\\nyou\\n \\nc)   How to get an agency to teach you new skills\\n \\nd)  How to get af filiates launched and integrated\\n \\n6)  When advertising in the real world: The Rule of 100 and Open to\\nGoal\\n \\na)   The five step one-page advertising plan to get more\\nleads today .\\n \\n7)  The seven levels of advertisers and the $100M leads  machine in\\naction.\\n \\nAs I promised in the beginning, the result of these bullets is more,\\nbetter , cheaper , reliable engaged leads. I hope this book provides\\nyou utility . I hope as a result of reading this you know how to get\\nmore leads than you currently are. And I hope I unmasked the\\nmystery behind lead getting.\\n \\nAlso, since you are one of the few who actually finish what you\\nstart, I want to leave you with a parting gift: a fable that has gotten\\nme through my hardest times.\\n \\n \\nThe Many Sided Die\\n \\n \\nImagine you and a friend play a dice-rolling game. Y ou are each\\ngiven one die. One of the die has 20 sides. The other has 200. On\\neach die, only one side is green. And the rest, are red.\\n \\nThe point of the game is simple: Roll gr een as many times as you\\ncan.\\n \\nThe rules of the game are as follows:\\n \\nY ou can’ t see how many sides you have. Y ou can only see if you\\nr oll r ed or gr een.\\n \\nIf you r oll gr een–One of your r ed sides turns gr een, and you get\\nto r oll again. \\n \\nIf you r oll r ed–Nothing happens, and you get to r oll again.\\n \\nThe game ends when you stop r olling. And if you stop r olling,\\nyou lose. \\n \\nWhat do you do?\\n \\nY ou r oll.  When you roll red, you pick up the die and roll again.\\nWhen others roll green, you pick up your die and roll again. When\\nyou roll green, you pick up the die and roll again. Y ou keep telling\\nyourself one thing. “The more I roll, the more greens I get.” At\\nfirst, you roll green once in a while. But as more red sides turn\\ngreen, the greens happen more. W ith enough rolls, hitting green\\nbecomes the rule rather than the exception.\\n \\nWhat does your friend do?\\n \\nHe rolls a few times and hits red each time. He sees you roll a\\ngreen and complains that you must  have a die with fewer sides. He\\nreasons, it’ s the only  way you could have rolled green before him.\\nAnd although you did, you also rolled many more times. So which\\nis it?\\n \\nIn either case, he rolls a few more times in frustration and hits a\\ngreen. But then he complains about how long it took. He’ s spent\\nmore time watching you and complaining than actually playing.\\nMeanwhile, you’ve hit your green streak. It’ s so much easier for\\nyou , he tells himself.  Y ou get gr eens every time!  This game is\\nrigged, so what’ s the point? He quits.\\n \\n***\\n \\nSo who got the die with 20 sides? Who got the die with 200 sides?\\nIf you get the game then you see, once you roll enough times, the\\ndie you’r e given doesn’ t matter .\\n \\nDie with fewer sides might roll green sooner .\\n \\nDie with more sides might roll green later .\\n \\nBut, a die with a green side always  has a chance of rolling\\ngreen… if you r oll it.\\n \\nEvery die hits its green streak when rolled enough times.\\n \\nAll of us get a many-sided die. And looking at the other players,\\nyou have no idea if it’ s their 100th roll or their 100,000th. Y ou\\ndon\\'t know how “good” other players are when they start, you can\\nonly see how well they do now . But, if you understand the game,\\nyou also know it doesn’ t matter .\\n \\nA few begin playing early . Others begin much later . The rest sit on\\nthe sidelines complaining about how lucky the players are. I guess\\nso, but they’re luckier because they play . And when they hit red,\\nwhich they do, they didn’ t quit. They rolled again.\\n \\nLearning to advertise is a lot like the game of the many sided die.\\nY ou do not know if it will work until you try . And when you start\\nadvertising, you will probably hit red on your first rolls. But if you\\ntry enough times you will hit gr een.  And when  it works, you have a\\nbetter chance of getting it to work again. The more you do it, the\\neasier it gets. Y ou begin to understand the game. No matter how\\nmany players there are or the number of sides on the die you’re\\ngiven, you start to see the only two guarantees:\\n \\n1) The more times you roll, the better you get.\\n \\n2) If you quit, you lose\\n \\n \\n \\nSo here’ s my final promise:\\n \\nY ou cannot lose if you do not quit.\\nF r e e  G o o d i e s :  C a l l s  T o  A c t i o n\\nIf it’ s fr ee, it’ s for me!\\n \\n \\nI’m gonna give you a bunch of free stuf f in a second - so stay\\ntuned.\\n \\nDr . Kashey (my editor) and I spent over 3,500 hours on this book.\\nW e wrote 650+ pages and 19 drafts with varying frames, themes,\\nand points of focus. But ultimately , the changes left only the most\\ndistilled ‘need to knows’ inside. W e went through 127 pages of\\nhand drawn models to carve out the few that made it into the book.\\nAll that to say - I hope this work results in you growing the\\nbusiness of your dreams.\\n \\nWhen I look back on my life these books will be among the things\\nI am most proud of. I wouldn’ t be able to write as fervently if I\\ndidn’ t think people would read it. And as much as I strive to be the\\nman who would work as hard if nobody cared, I am not there yet.\\nY our support and positivity make a dif ference for me. So thank you\\nfrom the bottom of my heart for allowing me to do the work I find\\nmeaningful. I am forever grateful.\\n \\nIf you are new to #mozination, welcome. W e believe in big\\nambitions, and matching our ambitions with giving and patience.\\nAnd I have a personal goal in that spirit of giving: to die with\\nnothing left to give .\\n \\nSo if you’re still with me, thank you. I want to provide some more\\ngoodies.\\n \\n1)  If you’r e struggling to figur e out  who  to sell to , I released a\\nchapter called “Y our First A vatar” between this book and the\\nlast. Think of it like a ‘single’ from a music album. Y ou can get\\nit for free at Acquisition.com/avatar .  Just pop in your email\\nand we’ll send it over . \\n \\n2)  If you’r e struggling to figur e out what  to sell , you can go to\\nAmazon or wherever you buy books and search “Alex Hormozi”\\nand $100M Of fers. It should get you on the right path. The\\ndigital version is available for sale at the cheapest price that the\\nplatform would let me make it and still list it as a book. \\n \\n3)  If you’r e struggling with getting people to buy , my next book\\nwill be on persuasion and sales.  It may or may not be out by\\nthe time you read this. It’ll either be called $100M Sales or\\nPersuasion. I haven’ t decided yet. But if you search my name\\nyou can look for any other books that may be out by the time\\nyou read this. \\n \\n4)  If you want a job at Acquisition.com  or in one of our portfolio\\ncompanies - we love hiring from #mozination. W e love doing\\nthis because we’ve found our best returns investing in great\\npeople. Go to Acquisition.com/car eers/open-jobs , and you can\\nsee all the job openings across all our companies and our\\nportfolio. \\n \\n5)  If your company is over $1M in EBITDA (pr ofit) , we’d love\\nto invest in your business to help you scale. It brings so much\\npleasure to know our portfolio companies have grown much\\nbigger and faster than mine because they avoided the mistakes I\\nmade . If you want us to take a look under the hood and see if we\\ncan help go to Acquisition.com . Sending your info is fast and\\neasy .\\n \\n6)  T o get the free book downloads and video trainings that come\\nwith this book, go to Acquisition.com/training/leads .\\n \\n7)  If you like listening to podcasts and want to hear mor e , my\\npodcast at the time of this writing is top 5 in entrepreneurship\\nand top 15 in business in the US. Y ou can get there by searching\\n“Alex Hormozi” wherever you listen. Or , by going to\\nAcquisition.com/podcast . I share useful and interesting stories,\\nvaluable lessons, and the essential mental models I rely on every\\nday . \\n \\n8)  If you like to watch videos , we put a lot of resources into our\\nfree training, available for everyone. W e intend on making it\\nbetter than any paid stuf f out there, and let you decide if we\\nsucceeded. Y ou can find our videos on Y ouT ube or wherever\\nyou watch videos by searching “Alex Hormozi”.\\n \\n9)  And if you like short form videos , check out the bite sized\\ncontent we pump out on the daily at Acquisition.com/media .\\nY ou’ll see all the places we post and you can pick the ones you\\nlike the most.\\n \\nAnd last, thank you again.

I spend a lot of time there, so it’ s a lot of vibes. May\\nyour desire be greater than your obstacles.\\n \\nHope to meet you and your company soon.

Our portfolio includes software, e-commerce,\\nbusiness services, consumer services, brick & mortar chains,\\ndigital products, and plenty of others.

That means for every $1 I spend on\\nadvertising, I get $36 back. A return of 3600%. Some people built\\ntheir wealth in the stock market. Others in real estate. I built mine\\nadvertising.\\n \\nThis year I surpassed $100,000,000 in net worth at age 32. And if\\nyou’re from the future, that’ s in 2022 US Dollars.
