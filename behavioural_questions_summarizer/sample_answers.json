    "sample_answer": "“Currently, I’m leading a project to significantly improve our real-time bidding (RTB) campaign optimization using a layered approach. Essentially, we’re building a system to dynamically adjust bids based on a more granular understanding of user intent and contextual signals. \n\nIt’s a complex undertaking, and we’re leveraging a combination of technologies. We've built a Kafka pipeline to ingest raw web traffic data – impressions, clicks, page views – in near real-time. This data is then streamed into a PySpark cluster on AWS EMR, where we’re applying several layers of enrichment. \n\nFirstly, we’re using PySpark to perform initial feature engineering – calculating things like time-of-day, device type, geographic location, and browsing history.  Crucially, we’re integrating a finetuned LLM – built using a variant of Llama 2 – to analyze the website content the user is viewing. We’ve finetuned it on our internal ad copy library and brand guidelines to assess the semantic similarity between the webpage and the campaign objectives. This provides a richer signal than traditional keyword matching.\n\nThe enriched data is then pushed into a Snowflake data warehouse for long-term storage and analysis. Simultaneously, Spark Streaming is used to generate real-time bidding recommendations, which are then deployed through our bidding engine. \n\nWe’re employing Apache Flink for stateful stream processing to maintain bidding strategies over time. And we’re heavily utilizing AWS services like Lambda and Step Functions for orchestration and scalability. \n\nA key challenge we’re tackling is managing the latency – we're aiming for sub-second response times. We’re using techniques like materialized views and optimized Spark configurations to achieve this.  It's a multi-faceted project that really allows us to harness the power of real-time data and AI to deliver a significantly higher ROAS for our clients. I’m focused on ensuring the entire pipeline is robust, scalable, and continuously learning through monitoring and data drift analysis.”"

    "sample_answer": "“Currently, we’re building a real-time attribution engine for our flagship programmatic campaign – essentially, tracking the impact of every ad interaction across all channels in near real-time. The biggest challenge, frankly, isn’t any single technology, but the integration and velocity of the data itself. \n\nWe’re ingesting data from a massive, highly variable ecosystem: Google Ads, Facebook, DV360, YouTube, and a growing number of smaller DSPs, all feeding into Kafka. This data is arriving with significant schema drift and varying levels of quality. We’re primarily using PySpark and Spark Streaming to process this data in real-time, building out a robust data pipeline. \n\nThe core complexity lies in dealing with this volume and velocity while simultaneously ensuring data accuracy – particularly around incrementality testing and avoiding spurious correlations. We’ve implemented sophisticated anomaly detection using PySpark MLlib, but it's a constant arms race.  \n\nTo address the schema drift, we've been experimenting with a layered approach: initial standardization via Spark, then leveraging a Synapse Analytics data warehouse for historical analysis, and a smaller, more agile Snowflake instance for low-latency querying for the attribution models themselves. \n\nMore recently, we've started incorporating LLM finetuning – specifically, using a custom-trained model to normalize and contextualize the ad interaction data before feeding it into our traditional attribution algorithms. This is proving valuable in reducing noise and improving model accuracy. \n\nThe biggest bottleneck right now is ensuring the data quality at the source, so we’re actively working with our partnerships to establish clearer, more consistent reporting standards. It's a complex puzzle of scale, velocity, and data integrity, and it’s pushing us to constantly refine our architecture and our data governance processes.”"

  "What was the most difficult bug that you fixed in the past 6 months?": {
    "intent": "Assess problem-solving skills and technical ability.",
    "sample_answer": "\"Okay, the most challenging bug I tackled in the last six months was related to real-time bidding data ingestion and anomaly detection within our Spark Streaming pipeline. We were using Kafka to capture impressions, clicks, and conversions, and then processing that data in PySpark to calculate key metrics like CPM and CTR for our clients' campaigns.\n\nThe issue was intermittent, but consistently, we were seeing a significant spike in reported click-through rates – sometimes exceeding 500% of the historical average – during peak ad campaign activity. Initially, we suspected a simple data skew, so we ran extensive SQL queries against our Snowflake data warehouse to identify obvious outliers, but nothing explained the scale.\n\nDigging deeper, I realized the problem wasn’t the *data* itself, but the way we were aggregating it within our Spark Streaming job. Specifically, the job was using a rolling average calculated over a 5-minute window, and we were introducing a subtle bias due to the way we were handling missing values.  When a data point was missing for a short period, the average was disproportionately influenced by the last available data, leading to a dramatic upward shift.\n\nTo resolve this, I completely redesigned the aggregation logic. Instead of relying solely on a rolling average, I implemented a more robust anomaly detection algorithm using PySpark’s MLlib library – specifically, a simple exponential smoothing model.  Crucially, I also adjusted our handling of missing values to use imputation based on the previous day's data rather than just relying on the last available point. \n\nBeyond the technical solution, I collaborated closely with the data science team to validate the changes and to ensure the new model aligned with their broader campaign attribution goals. We deployed the changes using our CI/CD pipeline on AWS EKS with Argo Workflows for increased automation.  The fix not only eliminated the false anomalies but also improved the stability and accuracy of our real-time bidding metrics. \n\nIt highlighted the importance of understanding the subtle statistical biases that can creep into streaming data pipelines and the need for robust, model-driven anomaly detection, particularly when dealing with high-velocity, potentially noisy data – which is exactly what we're dealing with in the live bidding environment.\""

Let me walk you through one recently. \n\nWe were tasked with dramatically improving the real-time attribution of brand lift campaigns for a major automotive client. The existing system was lagging – reporting attribution data was often 24-48 hours behind, making it nearly useless for immediate campaign optimization.\n\nMy day started with a quick stand-up with the campaign team, understanding their immediate needs – they wanted to react to a competitor's sudden surge in digital spend. I immediately shifted to troubleshooting our Kafka ingestion pipeline for campaign event data. We’d built it primarily with Python and Kafka Connect, but we’d identified a bottleneck – the data was being serialized inefficiently, causing latency. I leveraged PySpark to create a streaming data transformation job that efficiently parsed the data, enriched it with lookups from our CRM database via SQL, and then streamed it directly into a Snowflake data warehouse. We’d previously been relying on batch processing, which was a significant delay.\n\nThroughout the morning, I collaborated with the data scientists who were building their attribution models. They were using the new, low-latency data to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) for sentiment analysis of social media conversations surrounding the brand – essentially predicting brand lift in real-time.  We were experimenting with prompt engineering and finetuning the model on conversational data to improve accuracy. \n\nThe afternoon involved monitoring the Spark Streaming jobs and the Snowflake performance, ensuring everything was running smoothly. I also documented the changes we made, anticipating future scaling needs.  \n\nCrucially, by the end of the day, the data scientists were able to use the near-real-time data to immediately adjust bids within their campaign management system, leading to a 15% increase in brand lift – a direct result of our optimized data flow. It wasn’t flashy, but it was incredibly satisfying knowing we built a system that actively drove impactful decisions.

I’d like to share a technique I’ve been utilizing to dramatically improve the real-time anomaly detection within our campaign attribution models – specifically leveraging PySpark Streaming and Kafka with a light LLM finetune.\n\nCurrently, we rely on traditional threshold-based anomaly detection, which, while functional, struggles with the sheer volume and complexity of data streaming from our DSPs and ad exchanges. It’s reactive, not proactive. \n\nWhat I've done is build a small stream processing pipeline. Using Kafka, we ingest near real-time clickstream data.  Within PySpark Streaming, I’ve implemented a model trained on historical campaign performance data, but instead of just flagging outliers based on static thresholds, I’m utilizing a smaller, fine-tuned LLM – essentially a distilled version of a model we used for broader brand sentiment analysis – to assess the *context* of the anomaly. \n\nFor instance, a sudden spike in conversions might initially trigger an alert. But the LLM, informed by the campaign’s creative, target audience demographics, and recent ad spend, can quickly determine if this spike is genuinely positive – perhaps a successful influencer campaign – or if it represents a potential issue like a misconfigured bidding strategy. This contextual understanding significantly reduces false positives and allows our analysts to react with greater precision. \n\nWe're using AWS – specifically Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Analytics, and Lambda – to orchestrate this. The LLM is hosted on SageMaker, and we're exploring techniques like LoRA for efficient finetuning. \n\nI'd be happy to walk you through a simplified diagram of the architecture if you’d like a deeper dive, and I’m keen to hear your thoughts on how this approach could be applied to your team's challenges.”"

Initially, we were pulling data from Google Ads and Facebook Ads using their APIs, pushing it into Snowflake, and then running daily ETL jobs using PySpark to transform and load it into our data lake on S3. \n\nWe quickly realized the volume was exceeding our capacity. The Spark jobs were taking significantly longer than anticipated, leading to delays in our attribution dashboards. To address this, I took a multi-pronged approach. First, I quickly profiled the data – using SQL and Spark – to identify the biggest bottlenecks – specifically, nested JSON structures within the Google Ads data that required significant parsing. \n\nSecond, I refactored the Spark jobs using PySpark’s DataFrame API, optimizing the parsing and data transformations. I also implemented a caching layer using Redis to reduce the need to recompute frequently accessed datasets.  Third, recognizing the need for real-time insights, I prototyped a small Spark Streaming application using Kafka to ingest real-time Google Ads data and feed it directly into a dashboard, supplementing our scheduled batch processing.  Finally, I collaborated with the LLM team who were building campaign models - we found a direct feed of pre-processed data significantly improved the finetuning process. \n\nIt took about a week of focused effort, and we successfully scaled our processing capacity, reduced latency, and ensured we met the campaign’s data requirements.  The key takeaway for me was the importance of proactive data profiling, optimized code, and leveraging the right tools – in this case, both the technology *and* a collaborative approach across teams – to handle unexpected workloads. It reinforced the importance of always thinking about scalability and performance from the outset.”"

We've had promising results using PySpark to prepare this data for training, then deploying the finetuned model using AWS SageMaker. \n\nI enjoy this work because it directly impacts our agency’s ability to optimize campaigns in real-time, driving significant revenue. It's a really rewarding combination of technical problem-solving, data science, and strategic impact.”"

    "intent": "Assess continuous learning and adaptability.",
    "sample_answer": "\"That’s a fantastic question. Staying current in our field is absolutely critical, and I’ve built a multi-faceted approach. Firstly, I dedicate approximately 8-10 hours a week specifically to learning – it's non-negotiable. \n\nWithin that time, I regularly engage with industry-leading blogs and newsletters like Towards Data Science, QuantStart, and the Apache Spark website.  I also follow key thought leaders on Twitter – people like Marco van der Wulff and Tim Stevens. \n\nMore practically, I’m deeply involved with the open-source communities surrounding the tools we use daily. I'm an active contributor to the Apache Spark Slack channel, and I routinely participate in PySpark user groups, both online and occasionally in person.  We recently adopted a new LLM for campaign creative generation, so I’ve been focused on exploring finetuning techniques using tools like Ray and DeepSpeed – directly experimenting with datasets and model architectures. \n\nFrom a broader architectural perspective, I’m consistently evaluating advancements in streaming data pipelines. We've been piloting Kafka Streams and exploring advancements in Spark Streaming, and I’m always looking at how new cloud-native services on AWS – like Kinesis Data Streams and Lambda – can improve our scalability and cost-effectiveness.  \n\nFinally, I believe in knowledge sharing. I regularly present updates on new technologies and best practices to my team, which helps drive innovation across the entire data engineering organization. It's a continuous cycle of learning, applying, and sharing – that's how I ensure we remain at the forefront of data technology within this fast-paced advertising environment.\""
